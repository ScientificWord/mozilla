/** @brief This interface is implemented by any object that can be rendered 
 on the screen.

 This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology
  to retrieve information concerning the graphical representation of an object. 
  Coordinates used by the functions of this interface are specified in
  different coordinate systems.  Their scale is the same and is equal to
  that of the screen coordiante system.  In other words all coordinates
  are measured in pixels.  They differ in their respective origin:
  <ul>
   <li>The screen coordinate system has its origin in the upper left
    corner of the current screen.</li>
   <li>The origin of the parent coordinate system is the upper left corner
    of the parent's bounding box.  With no parent the screen coordinate
    system is used instead.</li>
  </ul>
