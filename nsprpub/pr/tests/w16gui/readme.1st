The files in the pr/tests/w16gui directory are taken
from "Programming Windows 3.1" by Charles Petzold,
specifically, the programs in chapter 14 related
to the "poppad4" sample application.

These programs are compiled with nspr20 to test nspr 2.0
and to demostrate the use of nspr in a gui application.

Library (DLL) PLDSxx.lib PLDSxx.dll is required to be
linked with this test case. Functions in this dll are
in the source ns/nspr20/lib/ds/plevent.* files.
