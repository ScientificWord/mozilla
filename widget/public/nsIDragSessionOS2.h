/**
 * nsIDragSessionOS2 encapsulates support for OS/2 dragover/drop events,
 * i.e. operations where Mozilla is the target of a drag (nsIDragService
 * handles source operations).  Its public methods correspond to the d&d
 * messages a PM window receives.  Its protected methods recast native
 * data as nsITransferable flavors during drag-enter and drop events.
 *
 * nsIDragSessionOS2 supports these native formats:  WPS Url objects,
 * files, the contents of files (Alt-drop), and text from DragText.
 * Data is presented to Mozilla as URI-text, HTML, and/or plain-text.
 * Only single-item native drops are supported.  If the dropped file
 * or text does not exist yet, nsIDragSessionOS2 will have the source
 * render the data asynchronously.
