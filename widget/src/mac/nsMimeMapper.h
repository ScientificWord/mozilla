//
// Contains the interface for |nsMimeMapper|, which is used to map between
// mozilla defined mime types (such as text/html or mozilla/toolbaritem) and
// MacOS flavors which are 4-character codes. Since's it's not easy to go
// from N characters down to 4 and back to N without loss, we need a different
// mechanism than just some hash algorithm.
//
// The way this is generally used is to instantiate a mime mapper when you're
// about to hand data to the OS and then ask it to map the mime type into a
// 4-character code. If it's not one that the mapper knows about intrinsically,
// it creates a unique type and remembers the mapping internally. Do this for each
// different flavor of data you have. Then, when you're ready to hand the
// data to the OS for real, ask the mapper to export its mapping list (with
// ExportMapping()) which can be put into a special, well known, data flavor 
// that goes into the OS along with the data.
//
// When pulling data out of the OS and into mozilla, the mapper is used to
// convert from the 4-character codes the OS knows about back to the original mime
// types. At this stage, depending the originator of the data (mozilla or some other
// mac app), you may or may not have a mapping flavor which explicitly lays out the 
// conversions. If you do, load it (you have to do this yourself) and pass it to the
// ctor. If you don't, that's ok too and the well-known mappings can still be performed.
