  <!-- A deck element also lays out its children on top of each other much like
  the stack element, however decks only display one of thier children at a time.
  Like stacks, the direct children of the deck element form the pages of the deck.
  If there are three children of the deck element, the deck will have three children.
  The displayed page of the deck can be changed by setting an index attribute on
  the deck element. The index is a number that identifies which page to display.
  Pages are numbered starting from zero. So the first clild of the deck is page 0,
  the second is page 1 and so on.   -->

    <description value="This is the first page"/>
