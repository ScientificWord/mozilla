/*
 Assumptions:

 The attribute currentValue will throw an exception
 if it cannot be set i.e. if the value is not a
 member of the interval.
 This may not be the 'desired' behaviour given gObject
 equivalent. Thus it could be changed to be:

 readonly attribute double currentValue;
 boolean setCurrentValue (double long value);

 GValue can represent many basic types.
 Since this interface is designed to represent
 an interval and a member of double should
 cover the cases of char int and float.
