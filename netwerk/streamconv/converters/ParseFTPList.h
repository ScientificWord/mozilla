/* ParseFTPList() parses lines from an FTP LIST command.
**
** Written July 2002 by Cyrus Patel <cyp@fb14.uni-mainz.de>
** with acknowledgements to squid, lynx, wget and ftpmirror.
**
** Arguments:
**   'line':       line of FTP data connection output. The line is assumed
**                 to end at the first '\0' or '\n' or '\r\n'. 
**   'state':      a structure used internally to track state between 
**                 lines. Needs to be bzero()'d at LIST begin.
**   'result':     where ParseFTPList will store the results of the parse
**                 if 'line' is not a comment and is not junk.
**
** Returns one of the following:
**    'd' - LIST line is a directory entry ('result' is valid)
**    'f' - LIST line is a file's entry ('result' is valid)
**    'l' - LIST line is a symlink's entry ('result' is valid)
**    '?' - LIST line is junk. (cwd, non-file/dir/link, etc)
**    '"' - its not a LIST line (its a "comment")
**
** It may be advisable to let the end-user see "comments" (particularly when 
** the listing results in ONLY such lines) because such a listing may be:
** - an unknown LIST format (NLST or "custom" format for example)
** - an error msg (EPERM,ENOENT,ENFILE,EMFILE,ENOTDIR,ENOTBLK,EEXDEV etc).
** - an empty directory and the 'comment' is a "total 0" line or similar.
**   (warning: a "total 0" can also mean the total size is unknown).
**
** ParseFTPList() supports all known FTP LISTing formats:
** - '/bin/ls -l' and all variants (including Hellsoft FTP for NetWare); 
** - EPLF (Easily Parsable List Format); 
** - Windows NT's default "DOS-dirstyle";
** - OS/2 basic server format LIST format;  
** - VMS (MultiNet, UCX, and CMU) LIST format (including multi-line format);
** - IBM VM/CMS, VM/ESA LIST format (two known variants);  
** - SuperTCP FTP Server for Win16 LIST format;  
** - NetManage Chameleon (NEWT) for Win16 LIST format;  
** - '/bin/dls' (two known variants, plus multi-line) LIST format;
** If there are others, then I'd like to hear about them (send me a sample).
**
** NLSTings are not supported explicitely because they cannot be machine 
** parsed consistently: NLSTings do not have unique characteristics - even 
** the assumption that there won't be whitespace on the line does not hold
** because some nlistings have more than one filename per line and/or
** may have filenames that have spaces in them. Moreover, distinguishing
** between an error message and an NLST line would require ParseList() to
** recognize all the possible strerror() messages in the world.
