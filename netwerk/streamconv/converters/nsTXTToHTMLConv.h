/**
 * Convert plain text to HTML.
 *
 * OVERVIEW OF HOW THIS CLASS WORKS:
 *
 * This class stores an array of tokens that should be replaced by something,
 * or something that should be prepended.
 * The "token" member of convToken is the text to search for. This is a
 * substring of the desired token. Tokens are delimited by TOKEN_DELIMITERS.
 * That entire token will be replaced by modText (if prepend is false); or it
 * will be linkified and modText will be prepended to the token if prepend is
 * true.
 *
 * Note that all of the text will be in a preformatted block, so there is no
 * need to emit line-end tags, or set the font face to monospace.
 *
 * This works as a stream converter, so data will arrive by
 * OnStartRequest/OnDataAvailable/OnStopRequest calls.
 *
 * OStopR will possibly process a remaining token.
 *
 * If the data of one pass contains a part of a token, that part will be stored
 * in mBuffer. The rest of the data will be sent to the next listener.
 * 
 * XXX this seems suboptimal. this means that this design will only work for
 * links. and it is impossible to append anything to the token. this means that,
 * for example, making *foo* bold is not possible.
