   * The "canonical" manifest is a plaintext file which sits outside of a

   * this function which reads a contents.rdf manifest and writes it to a file.
   *
   * @param aOldManifestURI  The URI of an old manifest to read, without
   *                         the trailing "contents.rdf", e.g.
   *                         "jar:resource:///chrome/foo.jar!/content/foo/" or
   *                         "file://path/to/contents/rdf/"
   * @param aFile            The URI of a manifest file to write. It's a good
   *                         idea to use a resource: URI if possible.
   * @param aBaseURI         The base URI for relative path creation
   *                         "jar:resource:///chrome/foo.jar!/content/foo/"
   *                         this is a separate param from aOldManifestURI so
   *                         the "contents.rdf" can be read outside of the jar
   *                         to keep the zipreader cache from holding it open.
   * @param aAppend          Whether we should append to an existing manifest
   *                         or truncate and start empty.
   * @param aSkinOnly        Only allow skin packages.
