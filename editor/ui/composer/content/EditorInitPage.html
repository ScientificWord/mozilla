<p>This is a good place to add in <b>html</b> to aid in testing features 
under development.  It's also a great place to not use latin.

Here is an acute entity: "&aacute;".
This&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;two&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tags&nbsp;&nbsp;between&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;word.
</p>

This paragraph is inside a &lt;div&gt;. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Here is some
rather boring text that is a link.</a>  Now is the time for all good men (and women)
to come to the mozilla.org party.  And bring the quick brown fox and the lazy dog with you.
For your editing pleasure, here is some <span style="font-weight:bold;">inline style</span> for you.
<a name="test1"></a>A Named Anchor is just before this sentence.
</p>
</div>

<p class="note">
&quot;This paragraph has &quot;class=note&quot;, so that we can play with styles.&quot;
For example, we might insert generated content, like &quot;Note:  &quot; before this
paragraph.
</p>

Here is some very run-o-the-mill text in a paragraph tag, for those
of you who are into that kind of thing. I think at this point I shall
regale you with some of my inestimable poetry, which will be presented
in blockquote mode for your reading pleasure.  This particular sample
was written when I was eleven years old, but is remarkably similar to 
the writings of my later "hard-livin" years.  It's titled "Reruns":
</p>

<blockquote class="poem" type="cite">
<h4>Reruns</h4>
Reruns are about as much fun,<br>
as your dad taking all your mun,<br>
and giving it to a nun,<br>
as a contribution.
</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are 4 br tags on either side of this sentence.

One more paragraph for the road.  A true Klingon fears not the atrocious
editing file format hoisted on us by html.  Well, maybe he does, a little.
But he hides it well.
