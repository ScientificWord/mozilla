This document describes the rich text editing controls for web pages
available in recent mozilla browsers.<br>
<br>
<h1> Enabling Rich Text Editing in your web page:</h1>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Given a document, you can add the
attribute "designMode" and set it to "on" to get an editable document.&nbsp;
For example, in JavaScript, if you have an iframe with an id of 'edit', you
can get its contentDocument and set designMode to "on" like this:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>document.getElementById("edit").contentDocument.designMode="on";</code></div>
<br>
Right now, you can't completely turn off editing by setting designMode
to "off."&nbsp; Setting designMode to "off" will prevent certain operations
from being handled but typing and other actions are still possible.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h1>Invoking Commands:</h1>
<h2>execCommand</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Given a document that has rich text
editing enabled (see above), you can invoke specific commands on the
document by calling execCommand with 3 parameters.&nbsp; For example,
in JavaScript, if you have an editable document,
you can invoke the bold command by calling this:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>editableDocument.execCommand("Bold",
false, null);</code></div><br>
Notes:&nbsp; If you haven't set designMode to "On", you will get an
error.&nbsp; This could also happen if you call execCommand with the wrong
document.<br>
<br>
There are 3 required parameters for execCommand:<br>
<ol>
  <li>command string</li>
  <li>boolean flag for showing UI</li>
  <li>value string</li>
</ol>
The first parameter is a string which contains the command.&nbsp; The
second parameter is a boolean flag. &nbsp;If it is set to true, you will
get an error (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED). &nbsp;The third parameter is a
string which is the value.&nbsp; Some commands will require details such
as the particular size you want to set when setting a font size.<br>
<br>
The section on Supported Commands will document each command and any
corresponding values needed.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
<br>
<h2>queryCommandEnabled</h2>
<blockquote>This command operates on the editable document.&nbsp; There
is one required parameter (the command string). &nbsp;The result is a
boolean which is true if the command is can be done given the current
selection and/or caret position. &nbsp;The result is false if the command
should not be invoked (execCommand) given the current selection and/or
caret position.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>queryCommandState</h2>
<blockquote>This section needs to be written.&nbsp; It can be called
similarly to IE implementation.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>queryCommandValue</h2>
<blockquote> This section needs to be written.&nbsp; It can be called
similarly to IE implementation.

<h1>Supported Commands:</h1>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The following list of commands is
presented in alphabetical order. &nbsp;The commands may be mixed case
or whatever makes your code more readable.<br>
