nested table, good syntax.
<table border>
  <tr>
	  <td>This is the first cell in the table
    <td>This is the second cell in the table
     <TABLE BORDER>
       <TR>
         <TD>inner cell
     </TABLE>
  <tr>
    <td>This is the third cell in the table
    <td>This is the fourth cell in the table
</table>
