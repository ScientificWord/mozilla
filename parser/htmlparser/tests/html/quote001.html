    <title>HTML test for quoted string
	</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  This was created on 9/12/97, for Xena bug # 85121
  <br>Testing the quoted value string.
  <br> tag A is used so you can check the string by moving mouse on the link.
  <br> use view source or text editor to compare with browser display.
  
  <br> The goal is to be compatible with Navigator 4.0
  <br> Test results are compared with Nav4.0 display. Relavent Nav4.0 source
  files are ns\lib\libparse\pa_parse.c and others.
  <br> Differences between 4.0 and xena are indecated. Search for XENA60
  to find all the defferences.

  <br><br> comments from ns\xena\lego\src\lego\html\scanner\HTMLScanner.java:
  <br>// For quoted value string :
  <br>// Double/single quote only take effect as the first char
  <br>// of the value string,
  <br>// Quoted string is terminated by the second double/single quote
  <br>// respectively.
  <br>// In other places, double/single quote is treated literally.
  <br>// Entity & quot; is always treated literally, enven it is the
  <br>// first char.
  <br>//
  <br>// Unquoted value string is terminated by while space, or '>' sign.
  <br><br>

  Test lines:
  
  <br>10(quote / quote ) good syntax: <a href="abcd"> both quotes striped from string</a>
  <br>20(  /  )<a href= abcd > value not quoted, not recommented, but still good syntax.</a>
  <br>30<a href="123456789123456789223456789323456789423456789523456789623456789723456789823456789923456789">
   Navigator 4.0 value string trunketed at 82 characters</a> XENA60 limit is MAX_STRING_LENGTH = 2000.

  <br>40 The following are illegal HTML, but handled by Nav4.0 in different ways.
  <br>50(  /  )<a href= abcd xyz > string not quoted, whight space terminates the value</a>
  <br>60(  /  )<a href= abcd
  xyz > string not quoted, CR terminates the string</a>
  <br>70(escaped-quote / quote ) <a href=&quot;abcd" > both quotes remain in string </a>
  <br>80(quote / ) <a href="abcd > no closing quote, Add a quote in text to protect next test line">
       move mouse on this. If we didn't have a quote in the text, the value string would
	   run through the end of the A tag.</a>
  <br>90(quote / escaped-quote ) <a href="abcd&quot;>  still in quote">same as above, escaped quote does NOT terminate quote </a>
  <br>100(  / quote)<a href=abcd"> if no opening quote, quotes are included in string</a>
  <br>110(  / quote)<a href=abcd"xyz> no opening quote, value terminated at right brack </a>
