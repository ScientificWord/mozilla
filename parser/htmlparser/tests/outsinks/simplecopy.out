Simple html page
Here is a link to the mozilla.org page. Here is some underlined and boldenedified text plus some <angle bracket entities>.

Here is a line ending with a space followed by a line break. Plaintext output should contain only one space (and no line breaks) between "space" and "followed".

Here is a list:

    * An item
    * A nested ordered list:
    *
         1. item one
         2. item two
    * last item

Here is a paragraph after the list.
