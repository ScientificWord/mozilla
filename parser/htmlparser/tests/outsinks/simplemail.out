This is a mail with a couple of long lines and 
then a sig. This is used as test of the 
format=flowed output in the nsHTMLToTXTSinkstream. 
If this test fails and none else, it's likely the 
spaces at the ends of the lines that are missing. 
They aren't easily seen without looking at the 
data in an editor and checking where the end of 
line is.

Above is NOT a sig delimiter since it's missing
