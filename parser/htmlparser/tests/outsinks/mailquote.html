This page is a test of mail quoting.

I hope you will enjoy these quotes from <em>Hamlet</em>, introduced by a fairly long line to see how quotations get wrapped:

<blockquote type="cite">
<em>(These have <b>br</b> tags after them.</em><br>
To be, or not to be, that is the question<br>

The slings and fortunes of outrageous fortune<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I.
</blockquote>
