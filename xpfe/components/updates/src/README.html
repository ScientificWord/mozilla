The updates.rdf datasource
</h2>
The updates.rdf datasource is an RDF file containing information about the latest updates available for the client.  It can be stored remotely.  
</span>

<h3>
The updates.rdf preference
</h3>
The updates.rdf datasource is stored in a localized pref in communicator-region's region.properties file.  The datasource pref is <code>update_notifications.provider.0.datasource</code>.  See the update notifications specification at: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpapps/updates/spec.html">http://www.mozilla.org/xpapps/updates/spec.html</a>.

<h3>
The updates.rdf format
</h3>
This RDF file stores the product name, the latest version available, the regsitry name (as registered in the mozilla version registry), and the URL to take users to if a new update has been detected and users wish to get it. The update notification module looks for this information rooted at the <code>urn:updates:latest</code> node.<p>

An example of the updates.rdf file follows:
