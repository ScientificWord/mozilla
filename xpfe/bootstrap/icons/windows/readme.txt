The icons in this directory are Win32 program icons, file association icons, 
and window icons (to appear in the upper left corner of various windows).



Requirements:
Each icon should contain the following devices images:
48x48, 32x32, and 16x16 - 16 color
48x48, 32x32, and 16x16 - True color
48x48, 32x32, and 16x16 - True color XP (Contains alpha shadows)

At this time, we don't think 256 color is a good idea since Windows does
a good job dithering and some systems will use 256 color icons even when
True Color exists.

See bug http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99380 for a lot of rambling about
icons.



Window icons:
Should be named using the following convention: [NAME]-window.ico where [NAME]
represents the name of the window. Example:
history-window.ico

Blank template icon should be available as: template-window.ico

XXXFIXME 
Some icons have been given names such as downloadManager.ico and is because 
there are two naming schemes for windows. This should be remedied.

XXXFIXME


File association icons:
Should be named using the following convention: [NAME]-file.ico where [NAME]
represents the type of file it is. Example:
image-file.ico

Blank template icon should be available as: template-file.ico


Program icon:
Currently, the only available program icon is mozilla.ico
