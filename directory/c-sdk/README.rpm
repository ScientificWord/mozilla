The mozldap.spec file can be used to build an RPM package.  This
spec file produces 3 packages:

mozldap - the core runtime shared libraries libssldap50.so,
libprldap50.so, and libldap50.so, along with major and minor
version symlinks (see the %files section).  These files are
placed in the system LIBDIR (usually /usr/lib or /usr/lib64).

mozldap-tools - the command line tools ldapsearch, ldapmodify,
ldapdelete, ldapcmp, ldapcompare - these are placed in a
subdirectory of LIBDIR called mozldap, so as not to conflict
with the OpenLDAP versions of ldapsearch, ldapmodify, etc.
which are present in almost every linux distro in /usr/bin
(the libs don't conflict because they have different names).
This package is not required if you only need the libs for
application support (e.g. Thunderbird), but it is a good
idea if you need to test some LDAP client feature that is
not supported by the OpenLDAP tools, or want to use NSS
for crypto with ldapsearch et. al.

mozldap-devel - the include files, example code, config files,
and pkg-config .pc file.  The include files are placed in a
mozldap subdirectory of the system INCDIR (usually /usr/include)
so as not to conflict with the OpenLDAP include files in
/usr/include.  The example code and config files go into the
/usr/share/mozldap directory.  The mozldap.pc file goes into
the usual pkg-config directory, so you can get information
about the lib and include directories when building other
applications that use mozldap, e.g.
    /usr/bin/pkg-config --cflags-only-I mozldap

Build Dependencies: nspr-devel, nss-devel, and svrcore-devel
Runtime Dependencies: nspr, nss

These packages should be available for download from ftp.mozilla.org
or from your favorite RPM/yum repository.  If these packages are
installed, and have the proper pkg-config installed, the rpmbuild
will automatically find them - see config/autoconf/*.m4.

This RPM uses NSS for crypto and SVRCORE for secure PIN
management, which in turn depend on NSPR.  If you do not want that,
you can create a new mozldap.spec file that removes those
dependencies (edit Requires: and BuildRequires:) and removes those
from the build (e.g. use --without-nss for the configure command).
