  /**
   * NOTE:
   *
   * Try to avoid flat strings.  |PromiseFlat[C]String| will help you as a last
   * resort, and this may be necessary when dealing with legacy or OS calls,
   * but in general, requiring a null-terminated array of characters kills many
   * of the performance wins the string classes offer.  Write your own code to
   * use |nsA[C]String&|s for parameters.  Write your string proccessing
   * algorithms to exploit iterators.  If you do this, you will benefit from
   * being able to chain operations without copying or allocating and your code
   * will be significantly more efficient.  Remember, a function that takes an
   * |const nsA[C]String&| can always be passed a raw character pointer by
   * wrapping it (for free) in a |nsDependent[C]String|.  But a function that
   * takes a character pointer always has the potential to force allocation and
   * copying.
   *
   *
   * How to use it:
   *
   * A |nsPromiseFlat[C]String| doesn't necessarily own the characters it
   * promises.  You must never use it to promise characters out of a string
   * with a shorter lifespan.  The typical use will be something like this:
   *
   *   SomeOSFunction( PromiseFlatCString(aCString).get() ); // GOOD
   *
   * Here's a BAD use:
   *
   *  const char* buffer = PromiseFlatCString(aCString).get();
   *  SomeOSFunction(buffer); // BAD!! |buffer| is a dangling pointer
   *
   * The only way to make one is with the function |PromiseFlat[C]String|,
   * which produce a |const| instance.  ``What if I need to keep a promise
   * around for a little while?'' you might ask.  In that case, you can keep a
   * reference, like so
   *
   *   const nsPromiseFlatString& flat = PromiseFlatString(aString);
   *     // this reference holds the anonymous temporary alive, but remember,
   *     // it must _still_ have a lifetime shorter than that of |aString|
   *
   *  SomeOSFunction(flat.get());
   *  SomeOtherOSFunction(flat.get());
   *
   *
   * How does it work?
   *
   * A |nsPromiseFlat[C]String| is just a wrapper for another string.  If you
   * apply it to a string that happens to be flat, your promise is just a
   * dependent reference to the string's data.  If you apply it to a non-flat
   * string, then a temporary flat string is created for you, by allocating and
   * copying.  In the event that you end up assigning the result into a sharing
   * string (e.g., |nsTString|), the right thing happens.
