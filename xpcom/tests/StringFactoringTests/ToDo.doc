// To Do...

  - Decide: do I really want to define |Equals| (i.e., so many extra signatures)

  . Make |ns[C]String| rename its converting operations to, e.g., |EqualsWithConversion|,
    |AssignWithConversion|, |CompareWithConversion|, |AppendWithConversion|, etc.

  . Bring |Equals| and |Compare| into scope

  . Implement chunky iterators

  . Get "nsAReadableString.h" and "nsAWritableString.h" to added to the MANIFEST, etc.

  - Get "nsAReadableString.h" and "nsAWritableString.h" to compile everywhere

  - Add test for |Replace|...

  - Add tests for Find and RFind

  - Implement the Find and RFind signatures

  . Fix Truncate / SetLength confusion (make SetLength the real function in |nsString|)

  . Chop out conflicting |ns[C]String| operators

  . Figure out how if we can make PRUnichar be wchar_t, so we get the cheap constructors,
      ...and ensure the cheap constructors can be made to work everywhere

  x Try the |static const unsigned long kLeftString = 1 - 1; /* because VC++ doesn't like =0 */| hack

  . Add tests for |nsShared[C]String|

  . Implement |nsShared[C]String|

  - Add tests for the shared string smart pointer

  . Implement the shared string smart pointer

  . Figure out why StdStringWrapper isn't as good as raw std::string

  - Implement a smart allocator for StdStringWrapper
