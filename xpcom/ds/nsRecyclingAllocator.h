/*
 * nsRecyclingAllocator
 *
 * This allocator is useful when we cycle through a small set of allocations
 * repeatedly with minimal overlap. For eg. something we do for every gif
 * file read (or) buffers required for decompression of every file from jar.
 *
 * What this does is keeps around the first set of memory allocated and
 * reuses it subsequently. If all buckets are full, this falls back to
 * malloc/free
 *
 * Uses a timer to release all memory allocated if not used for more than
 * 10 secs automatically.
 *
 * Also there is a 4 byte maintenance overhead on every allocation.
 *
 * This allocator is thread safe.
 *
 * CAVEATS: As the number of buckets increases, this allocators performance
 *          will drop, as the list of freed items is a linked list sorted on size.
