/* This class supports case insensitive lookup.
 *
 * It differs from atom tables:
 * - It supports case insensitive lookup.
 * - It has minimal footprint by not copying the string table.
 * - It does no locking.
 * - It returns zero based indexes and const nsCString& as required by its
 *   callers in the parser.
 * - It is not an xpcom interface - meant for fast lookup in static tables.
 *
 * ***REQUIREMENTS***
 * - It *requires* that all entries in the table be lowercase only.
 * - It *requires* that the table of strings be in memory that lives at least
 *    as long as this table object - typically a static string array.
