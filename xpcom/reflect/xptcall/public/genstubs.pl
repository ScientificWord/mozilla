# if "$entry_count" is ever changed and the .inc files regenerated then
# the following issues need to be addressed:
#
# 1) Alpha NT has a .def file that lists exports by symbol. It will need
#    updating.
# 2) The current Linux ARM code has a limitation of only having 256-3 stubs
#
# more dependencies???

# 3 entries are already 'used' by the 3 methods of nsISupports.
# 3+247+5=255 This should get us in under the Linux ARM limitation
