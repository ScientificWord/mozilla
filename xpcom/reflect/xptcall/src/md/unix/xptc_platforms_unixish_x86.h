/* Platform specific #defines to be shared by the various platforms sharing 
*  the unixish_86 code
*/

/*
*  The goal here is to clearly define the binary compatibility parameters for
*  the platforms that will use this code. Rather than switch at compile time
*  based on the compiler that happens to be in use we are forcing implementors
*  to make a conscious decision.
*
*  For some of these platforms the community may choose to have more than one
*  binary model in effect. In that case I suggest that there be explicit sub
*  defines for that platform specifying 'TYPE1', 'TYPE2', etc. The decision on
*  which 'TYPE' to use would be triggered by a setting passed through from the 
*  config system.
*
*  For example we might end up with something like:
*
* #elif defined(NTO) 
* #  if defined(TYPE1)
* #    define CFRONT_STYLE_THIS_ADJUST
* #  elif defined(TYPE1) 
* #    define THUNK_BASED_THIS_ADJUST
* #  else
* #    error "need TYPE1 or TYPE2 for NTO"
* #  endif
* #elif defined(__BEOS__) 
*
*  and so on....
*

 * 5.x, /usr/src/contrib/gcc/config/freebsd.h explicitly undef's
 * DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS.  (The one exception is a brief period (September
 * 1999 - Jan 2000) during 4.0-CURRENT, after egcs was merged --
 * this was changed before 4.0-RELEASE, but we can handle it anyway.)
 *
 * Versions of gcc from the ports collection (/usr/ports/lang/egcs),
 * however, have DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS #defined to 1, at least
 * in all ports collections since the 2.95 merge.  (Supporting optional
 * compilers from FreeBSD 3.2 or earlier seems unnecessary).
 *
 * The easiest way to distinguish the ports collection gcc from the system
 * gcc is that the system gcc defines __FreeBSD_cc_version.  This variable
 * can also identify versions that use thunks. This includes some 4.x versions
 * and now newer 5.x versions.
