	The result of the CallCopyObjectFilterProc function indicates if

	want to access from within the CallCopyObjectFilterProc.

							during iteration.
	currentLevel		--> The current recursion level into the container.
							1 = the container, 2 = the container's immediate
							subdirectories, etc.
	currentOSErr		--> The current error code, shows the results of the
							copy of the current object (ref)
	catalogInfo			--> The catalog information for the current object.
							Only the fields requested by the whichInfo

	The FSCopyObject function takes a source object (can be a file or directory)

	one subdirectory below the specified directory; etc. Set maxLevels to
	zero to scan all levels.
