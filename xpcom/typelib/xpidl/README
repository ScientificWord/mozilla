xpidl depends on Andrew Veliath and Elliot Lee's libIDL, a part of the
GNOME ORBit C ORB.  We currently require libIDL >= 0.6.3, which in turn
requires glib >= 1.2.0.

libIDL builds for Linux and Win32 can be found, along with source
tarballs, at http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/libIDL/, and Win32 users will
need glib 1.2 and glib 1.2-dev from
http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/.  Source and Linux RPMs are also
available from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/libraries, and Win32
binaries are included in the wintools.zip file at
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/source/wintools.zip.  A Mac project
is in progress, and should be appearing shortly.

glib tarballs and RPMs for Linux can be found through http://www.gtk.org.
