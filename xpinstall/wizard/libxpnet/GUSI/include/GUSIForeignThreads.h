//                                                                         
// As convenient as the pthreads interface is, some applications may link to other 
// libraries which create thread manager threads directly, such as the PowerPlant
// thread classes.                                                         
//                                                                         
// Unfortunately, there is no really elegant way to welcome these lost sheep into the
// pthread flock, since the thread manager offers no way to retrieve thread switching
// and termination procedures. We therefore have to resort to a violent technique used
// already successfully for MPW support: On CFM, we override the default entry point and
// use the CFM manager to find the real implementation.                    
//                                                                         
// For non-CFM, we unfortunately don't have such an effective technique, since the 
// thread manager is called through traps (and no, I'm not going to patch any traps
// for this). You will therefore have to recompile your foreign libraries with
// a precompiled header that includes \texttt{GUSIForeignThreads.h}.       
//
