;
;   The following Attributes can be overridden:
;   ------------------------------------------
;
;   SELECTED      - Component is selected to be installed by default.
;
;   UNSELECTED    - Component is to be displayed unselected in the Options
;                   dialog.  If the component is listed in the non-custom
;                   Setup Type section, it will be assumed to be selected
;                   by default.
;
;   ADDITIONAL    - Component is to be shown in the Additional Options
;                   dialog (2nd Options dialog) instead of the 1st Options
;                   dialog.
;
;   NOTADDITIONAL - Component will be shown (if visible) in the 1st
;                   1st Options dialog rather than the Additional Options
;                   dialog (default).
;
;   VISIBLE       - Component is shown in one of the two Options dialogs
;                   (default).
;
;   INVISIBLE     - Component is not shown in either of the two Options dialogs.
;
;   ENABLED       - Component is to be shown as enabled (not greyed out) in
;                   either of the two Options dialogs.
;                   (default).
;
;   DISABLED      - Component is to be shown as disabled (greyed out) in
;                   either of two Options dialog.
;
;
;   The following attributes cannot be overridden:
;   ---------------------------------------------
;
;   LAUNCHAPP     - Component is downloaded and simply run (like a .exe file)
;                   after all the components have been downloaded and
;                   xpinstall'ed.
;
;   DOWNLOAD_ONLY - Component is to be only downloaded to the ns_temp folder,
;                   then deleted as Setup is quitting.
;
;   FORCE_UPGRADE - Force Upgrade checks for a particular file or directory
;                   provided in the Force Upgrade FileX= key(s).  If any of
;                   the listed file or directory exists, then this component
;                   will have its SELECTED and DISABLED Attributes set
;                   automatically.  Force Upgrade will override the following:
;
;                       Random Install Percentage= setting
;                       UNSELECTED Attribute setting
;                       Dependency settings
;                       Dependee settings
;                       Setup Type settings - meaning that even if this
;                                             component is not listed in the
;                                             selected Setup Type, it will be
;                                             affected.
;
;   IGNORE_DOWNLOAD_ERROR  - If the component needs to be downloaded from a
;                            server, setting this attribute will indicate that
;                            any download error encountered will be ignored
;                            and treated as if there were no error.
;                            If the component does not need to be downloaded,
;                            then this attribute has no effect.
;
;   IGNORE_XPINSTALL_ERROR - If the component is a .xpi file, then any error
;                            resulting from the installation of the .xpi file
;                            will be ignored.  If the .xpi file is not to be
;                            installed, then this attribute is ignored.
;
;   SUPERSEDE     - Component is to be shown as disabled and unselected
;                   if a file exists.
;                   Use SupersedeType=File Exists to specify the type of comparison
;                   Use SupersedeFileX=File Name to specify the file
;                   Use SupersedeMinVersionX=a.b.c.d (optional) to specify the 
;                   minimum version of the file.  If the version of the existing file
;                   is greater than or equal to the SupersedeMinVersion the component
;                   will be superseded.
