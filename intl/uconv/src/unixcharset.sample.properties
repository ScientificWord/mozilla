# This file (unixcharset.sample.properties) is a sample file for
# mapping between nl_langinfo(CODESET) and the charset name aliases 
# that Mozilla uses. For Linux ($OSARCH=Linux) the file name would be
# unixcharset.Linux.properties
# These mappings are only needed if a nl_langinfo(CODESET)
# return value is in conflict with the Mozilla charset name 
# aliases.
#
# The left hand side specifies a nl_langinfo(CODESET) return 
# value to remap to right hand side Mozilla charset name alias.
#
# There are 2 ways to specify a mapping:
#
#  1) generic (all glib versions)
#  2) GLIBC version specific
#
# The generic form is:
#
#    nllic.$NLLIC_CODESET=$MOZ_CODESET
#
# eg:
#
#    nllic.KOI8=KOI8-R
#
# The GLIBC specific form is:
#
#    nllic.$GLIBC.$NLLIC_CODESET=$MOZ_CODESET
#
# (nllic = nl_langinfo(CODESET))
# (        nl l   i    c       )
#
# eg: for a glibc version 2.1.3:
#
#    nllic.2.1.3.KOI8=KOI8-R
#
# If different glibc versions of nl_langinfo(CODESET) need
# different remappings these may coexist in this file as needed.
#
# (To determine a system's glibc version use: glib-config --version)
#
#
# Note:
# At present this is a sample file.
# The nl_langinfo(CODESET) return values on Linux can be used
# directly and thus this file is not needed.
