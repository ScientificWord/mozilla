/**
 * A character set converter from HZ to Unicode.
 * 
 *
 * @created         08/Sept/1999
 * @author  Yueheng Xu, Yueheng.Xu@intel.com
 *
 * Note: in this HZ-GB-2312 converter, we accept a string composed of 7-bit HZ 
 *       encoded Chinese chars,as it is defined in RFC1843 available at 
 *       http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1843.html
 *       and RFC1842 available at http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1842.html.
 *        
 *       In an effort to match the similar extended capability of Microsoft Internet Explorer
 *       5.0. We also accept the 8-bit GB encoded chars mixed in a HZ string.
 *       But this should not be a recommendedd practice for HTML authors.
 *
 *       The priority of converting are as follows: first convert 8-bit GB code; then,
 *       consume HZ ESC sequences such as '~{', '~}', '~~'; then, depending on the current
 *       state ( default to ASCII state ) of the string, each 7-bit char is converted as an 
 *       ASCII, or two 7-bit chars are converted into a Chinese character.
