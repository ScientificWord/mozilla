1. This directly have not been turn on to build system yet. 
2. Currently, the implementation of the nsICaseConversion call the
   UCData package develped by Mark Leisher <mleisher@crl.nmsu.edu>. 
   I have not check in the package into the mozilla tree yet. You can get 
   the package from 
     ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/CLR/multiling/unicode/ucdata.tar.gz
   or 
     ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/CLR/multiling/unicode/ucdata.zip

   After you get the package, you need to put those file into different 
   place under Mozilla tree untill we check them in.

   a. put ucdata.c and ucdata.h into mozilla/modules/unicharutil/src
   b. put MUTTUCData.txt and ucgendat.c into mozilla/modules/unicharutil/tools
 
   You also need the Unicode data base from Unicode ftp site
     ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData-Latest.txt

   Put it under mozilla/modules/unicharutil/tools

3. The Window makefile work. I am still working on Mac and UNIX build
