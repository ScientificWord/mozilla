mozilla (19990624.M7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is SeaMonkey Milestone 7 !
  * Removed the so-called upstream changelog (fixes #39307 #39496 #40368).

  * Retried building without the static libraries. It actually worked,
    after two Makefile.ins backports from M8 :)

mozilla (19990527-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another try, the previous one didn't build, stopped in xpidl/build/
  * Fresh tarball from the FTP site.
  * I'll give up with NO_STATIC_LIB for now, let's just make something.
  * First attempt on the editor exclusion (in mozilla-editor package).

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Fri, 28 May 1999 16:08:56 +0200

mozilla (19990526-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New one, this time with .orig.tar.gz cleaned up.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Thu, 27 May 1999 19:31:13 +0200

mozilla (19990524-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another new tree, probably the last before M6 releases. Maybe it'll
    even build, who knows? ;)

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Tue, 25 May 1999 16:11:57 +0200

mozilla (19990521-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another try, more testing of --disable-static and some changes to 
    the rules file. Applied some more recent patches from CVS.
  * Build NSPR with pthreads support.
  * Building on pandora (fast!), but it'll depend on glibc2.1 :(

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Sun, 23 May 1999 14:10:53 +0200

mozilla (19990518-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bypassed the dangling symlinks with a "-" :(
  * Added some Conflicts/Replaces to libnspr to prevent clashes with the
    previous (unreleased) versions of it, 20 and 21.
  * Brent decided to split out mailnews from the main package, so it's
    now in mozilla-mailnews package. Quite a lot of changes to the rules
    and control file. Added appropriate Provides: because of that, so
    that's one less TODO item.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Wed, 19 May 1999 04:10:07 -0700

mozilla (19990515-1) unstable; urgency=low

mozilla (19990510-1) unstable; urgency=low

mozilla (19990505.M5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is SeaMonkey Milestone 5 !
  * The previous M4 builds didn't work out. This was released on my
    birthday, so it could even work ;)

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Mon, 10 May 1999 00:27:47 -0700

mozilla (19990415.M4-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Sun,  9 May 1999 15:08:39 -0700

mozilla (19990415.M4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Massive changes to debian/rules, now it actually works :o)
    + builds in a subdirectory (yipee!)
    + removes unneeded Makefiles
    + installs a proper copyright file
  * NSPR renamed to libnspr21{-dev}, thought I'm not sure it is the
    real version... we still have to hardcode the dependency :(

mozilla (19990410-1) unstable; urgency=low

    a bit.

mozilla (19990323-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a test release using CVS snapshots
  * Continuing to use Ray's debian/ dir (thanks again!).
  * Change moz-wrapper to use "apprunner" instead of the viewer (viewer is just 
    a test application.
  * Whoo-hoo -- it's running!

 -- Brent A. Fulgham <bfulgham@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Mar 1999 14:25:07 -0800

mozilla (19990317-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a test release done just to get things moving.

mozilla (19981211-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * UNRELEASED
  * UNFINISHED. TODO:
    * Check we're not compiling -DDEVELOPER_DEBUG.
    * Ensure nsprpub/config/UNIX.mk doesn't get a hardwired x86 reference.
    * Remove the ?widgets/src/gdk/depend.mk? as part of clean.
    * Remove the autogenerated files of htmlparser/src.
    * ~/.mozilla -> ~/.netscape fixes bug #?????.
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * New upstream tarball:
    * Includes glibc2.1 patches.
    * Configuration dir is now ~/.mozilla rather than ~/.netscape.
    * Default widget set has switched from Motif to Gtk. The Gtk version
      needed is newer than the one in frozen, so this for unstable only.
  * Moved libnspr into packages of its own (as non-mozilla software like
    Japhar uses it) and made mozilla depend on the runtime library package.
  * Removed YAFHintel (thanks to John Goerzen for reminding me).
  * [nsprpub/config/rules.mk] Use standard naming of shared library files
    and SONAMEs.
  * Make sure mozilla gets linked against the system libjpeg, libpng,
    libz and libxmltok1 (Fixes #30306).

mozilla (19981008-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * New upstream tarball. 
  * Adapted build process to it (nspr doesn't use autoconf and needs to be
    built before the regular autoconf build).
  * Built with fixed libc6 (and other fixed libs), so it works again.
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * [config/Linux.mk] Added EXTRA_DSO_LDOPTS = -lc to add dependency
    information to the shared libraries generated.
  * [nsprlib/config/Linux.mk] Added OS_LIBS = -lc to add dependency
    information to the shared libraries generated.

mozilla (19980904-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload: this package has been orphaned.
  * Used latest snapshot tarball; as no real mozilla releases have been made 
    so far, we use the snapshot date for the version number.
  * Previous versions were accidentally built as "Debian only" source.
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * Adapted to current mozilla source organisation and build process.
  * LessTif version, so mozilla can go in main.
  * Improved package relationships:
    * Added Provides: www-browser .
    * Added Recommends: mime-support .
    * Added Suggest dependency for postscript-viewer, pdf-viewer, images
      formats viewers, video formats viewers and audio formats players.
  * Added mozilla(1) -> unknown(7) manpage symlink.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Thu, 10 Sep 1998 21:58:26 +0200

mozilla (5.0b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mozilla-smotif and mozilla-dmotif conflict with and replace each
    other; both now provide mozilla, so that we can cope with a lesstif
    version when there is one.
  * Put packages in contrib and added a README.contrib-only file to explain
    why.
  * Tweaked ns/cmd/xfe/Makefile to force a build of the dynamic Motif version.
    My previous change to this had made both versions dynamically linked to
    Motif.  With no change at all, both versions were statically linked.

mozilla (5.0b1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Linked with Motif 2.1 and libc6
  * Modified ns/cmd/xfe/Makefile to force it to build a version dynamically
    linked to Motif.
  * Created -smotif and -dmotif packages.
  * New Maintainer

 -- Oliver Elphick <Oliver.Elphick@lfix.co.uk>  Tue,  7 Apr 1998 11:25:16 +0100

mozilla (5.0b1-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * I don't intend to maintain this package becuase:
    1. I don't have a libc6 motif (this is built with a libc5 motif, though
       the package only depends on libc6 and it works ok). Ideally, the
       maintainer should have libc6 motif.
    2. I don't have enough disk space, cpu time, bandwidth, or free time to
       maintain it.
    So this is just a quickie to get the package out. Somebody else should
    take it from here.
  * Applied some minor fixes to make it work. In particular, cmd/xfe/foo.c
    is a nasty hack to define a symbol that my motif libs needed.
