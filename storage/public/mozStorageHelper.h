/**
 * This class wraps a transaction inside a given C++ scope, guaranteeing that
 * the transaction will be completed even if you have an exception or
 * return early.
 *
 * aCommitOnComplete controls whether the transaction is committed or rolled
 * back when it goes out of scope. A common use is to create an instance with
 * commitOnComplete = FALSE (rollback), then call Commit on this object manually
 * when your function completes successfully.
 *
 * Note that nested transactions are not supported by sqlite, so if a transaction
 * is already in progress, this object does nothing. Note that in this case,
 * you may not get the transaction type you ask for, and you won't be able
 * to rollback.
