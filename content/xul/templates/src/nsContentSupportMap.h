/**
 * The nsContentSupportMap maintains a mapping from a "resource element"
 * in the content tree to the nsTemplateMatch that was used to instantiate it. This
 * is necessary to allow the XUL content to be built lazily. Specifically,
 * when building "resumes" on a partially-built content element, the builder
 * will walk upwards in the content tree to find the first element with an
 * 'id' attribute. This element is assumed to be the "resource element",
 * and allows the content builder to access the nsTemplateMatch (variable assignments
 * and rule information).
