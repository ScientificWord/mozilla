/**
 * A match object, where each match object is associated with one result.
 * There will be one match list for each unique id generated. However, since
 * there are multiple querysets and each may generate results with the same
 * id, they are all chained together in a linked list, ordered in the same
 * order as the respective <queryset> elements they were generated from.
 * A match can be identified by the container and id. The id is retrievable
 * from the result.
 *
 * Only one match per container and id pair is active at a time, but which
 * match is active may change as new results are added or removed. When a
 * match is active, content is generated for that match.
 *
 * Matches are stored and owned by the mMatchToMap hash in the template
 * builder.
