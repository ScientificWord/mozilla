 * - mChannel is non-null between asyncOpen and onStopRequest (NOTE: Only needs
 *   to be valid until onStopRequest is called on mFinalListener, not
 *   necessarily until the channel calls onStopRequest on us)
 * - mChannel corresponds to the channel that gets passed to the
 *   nsIRequestObserver/nsIStreamListener methods
 * - mChannel can be cancelled and ODA calls will stop
 * - mFinalListener is non-null (only) after onStartRequest has been called on
 *   it and before onStopRequest has been called on it
 *   (i.e. calling onStopRequest doesn't violate the nsIRequestObserver
 *   contract)
 * - mFrameLoader is null while this node is not in a document (XXX this
 *   invariant only exists due to nsFrameLoader suckage and needs to go away)
 * - mInstantiating is true while in LoadObject (it may be true in other
 *   cases as well). Only the function that set mInstantiating should trigger
 *   frame construction or notifications like ContentStatesChanged or flushes.
