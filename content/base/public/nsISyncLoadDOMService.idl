 *    This interface is DEPRECATED!                                      *
 *    You should instead use XMLHttpRequest which now works both from    *
 *    Javascript and C++.                                                *

 *    Additionally, synchronous network loads are evil.  Any delays      *
 *    from the server will appear as a hang in the mozilla UI.           *
 *    Therefore, they should be avoided as much as possible.             *
