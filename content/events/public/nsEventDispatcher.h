/**
 * About event dispatching:
 * When either nsEventDispatcher::Dispatch or
 * nsEventDispatcher::DispatchDOMEvent is called an event target chain is
 * created. nsEventDispatcher creates the chain by calling PreHandleEvent 
 * on each event target and the creation continues until either the mCanHandle
 * member of the nsEventChainPreVisitor object is PR_FALSE or the mParentTarget
 * does not point to a new target. The event target chain is created in the
 * heap.
 *
 * If the event needs retargeting, mEventTargetAtParent must be set in
 * PreHandleEvent.
 *
 * The capture, target and bubble phases of the event dispatch are handled
 * by iterating through the event target chain. Iteration happens twice,
 * first for the default event group and then for the system event group.
 * While dispatching the event for the system event group PostHandleEvent
 * is called right after calling event listener for the current event target.
