   *
   * If the icon data already exists, we won't normally try to re-load the
   * icon from the net (or more likely the cache). If the icon is in the
   * failed favicon cache we won't do anything. Use forceReload to force
   * a reload of the data. This will remove the favicon from the failed
   * cache. If it then fails again, it will be re-added to the failed cache.

   * be done at any time on a timer, so you should not let the message loop
   * run between calls or your icon may get deleted.

   * It is best to set the favicon data, and then associate it with a page.
   * This will make the notifications more efficient since the icon will
   * already have data when the set favicon observer messages goes out.

   * Potentially, many pages could be referencing the favicon and they could
