<!-- Localization note: The default intro text has 3 "inserts":
        #1 - replaced with the descriptive text that describes the mime type
             (e.g., "MSWord Document")
        #2 - replaced with the mime type (e.g., "application/ms-word")
        #3 - replaced with the filename (e.g., "manual.doc")
        #4 - will be replaced by the brand name (e.g., "Mozilla")
     If there is no descriptive text, then the alternative text is used which
     has only insert #2.
