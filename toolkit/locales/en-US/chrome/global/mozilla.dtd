'Mammon slept. And the <em>beast reborn</em> spread over the earth and its numbers
grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and <em>sacrificed</em> crops unto the
fire, with the <em>cunning of foxes</em>. And they built a new world in their own
image as promised by the <em><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html">
sacred words</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/About:mozilla">spoke
</a></em> of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was
<em>naught</em> but a follower.'>
