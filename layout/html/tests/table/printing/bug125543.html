          <BR>1.In many states the highway 
                          patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to 
                          remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
                          <P>2.You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and 
                          it will be gone in two days. 
                          <P>3.To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into 
                          the toilet <NOBR>bowl . . .</NOBR> Let the "real 
                          thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
                          <P>4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains from 
                          vitreous china. 
                          <P>5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub 
                          the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap 
                          aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola. 
                          <P>6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: 
                          Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble 
                          away the corrosion. 
                          <P>7.To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked 
                          in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 
                          <P>8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola 
                          into the baking pan;rap the ham in aluminum foil, and 
                          bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, 
                          remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with 
                          the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy. 
                          <P>9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of 
                          coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, And 
                          run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help 
                          loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze 
                          fromyour windshield. 
                          <P>FYI: 
                          <P>1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. 
                          It's pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 
                          days. 
                          <P>2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the concentrate) the 
                          commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place 
                          cards reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
                          <P>3.The distributors of coke have been using it to 
                          clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! 
                          Drink up! No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
                          drinks do to your teeth on a daily basis. A tooth will 
                          dissolve in a cup of coke in 24-48 hours 
                          </P>

        Many of the 
                  entries above are just simple household tips involving 
                  Coca-Cola. That you can cook and clean with Coke is relatively 
                  meaningless from a safety standpoint <NOBR>--</NOBR> you can 
                  use a wide array of common household substances (including 
                  water) for the same purposes; that doesn't necessarily make 
                  them dangerous. The fact is that <I>all</I> carbonated soft 
                  drinks contain <A

                  onclick='this.href="#origins";window.open("http://www.bartleby.com/65/ca/carbonic.html", "carbonic", "scrollbar=yes,menubar=yes,resizable=yes")' 
                  onmouseout="window.status='';return true"

                  face=Arial color=#cc0000>carbonic acid</FONT></A>, which is 
                  moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains and 
                  dissolving rust deposits (although plain soda water is much 
                  better for such purposes than Coca-Cola or other soft drinks, 
                  as it doesn't leave a sticky sugar residue behind). Carbonic 
                  acid is relatively weak, however, and people have been 
                  drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental 
                  effects. 
                  <P><A name=acid></A>The rest of the claims offered here are, 
                  in a word, stupid. Coca-Cola does contain small amounts of 
                  citric acid (from the orange, lemon, and lime oils in its 
                  formula) and phosphoric acid. However, all the insinuations 
                  about the dangers these acids might pose to people who drink 
                  Coca-Cola ignore a simple concept familiar to any first-year 
                  chemistry student: concentration. Coca-Cola contains less 
                  citric acid than orange juice does, and the concentration of 
                  phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 to 13 
                  grams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of 
                  the total formula) to harm anyone, no matter how much Coke he 
                  guzzles. The only people who proffer the ridiculous statements 
                  that Coca-Cola will dissolve a steak, a <A 
                  onmouseover="window.status='Tooth in Advertising';return true" 
                  onclick='this.href="#acid";window.open("tooth.htm")' 
                  onmouseout="window.status='';return true" 
                  href="http://www.snopes2.com/cokelore/tooth.htm"><FONT 
                  color=#cc0000>tooth</FONT></A>, or a nail in a matter of days 
                  are people who have never actually tried any of these things, 
                  because they just don't happen. (Anyone who conducts these 
                  experiments will find himself at the end of two days with a 
                  whole tooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy t-bone.) 
                  <P>The next time you're stopped by a highway patrolman, try 
                  asking him if he's ever cleaned blood stains off a highway 
                  with Coca-Cola. If you're lucky, by the time he stops laughing 
                  he'll have forgotten about the citation he was going to give 
                  you.
