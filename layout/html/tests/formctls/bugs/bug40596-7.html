                        This is the way all the tables below should be laid out... <br>
                        <TABLE border="1" width="400">
                                        <TR>

                        <BR>
                        This is the same table, only it has an input box with width = 100% in the right-most cell<BR>
                        Note that the width of the input box is not constrained by its container, as it should be<BR>
