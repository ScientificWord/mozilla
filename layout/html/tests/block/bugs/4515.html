    This should be floating left and be 30% wide.  Its border should
	touch its container's border.

  This is text in the containing <code>div</code>.  It should span the
  width of the <code>div</code> up to the edge of the float.  Therefore
  its left edge should touch the float and its right edge should touch
  the border of the containing <code>div</code>.
</div>

<div class="contain">

  </p>
  This is text in the containing <code>div</code>.  It should span the
  width of the <code>div</code> including 80px of the float.  Therefore
  its left edge should be 80px inside the float and its right edge should touch
  the border of the containing <code>div</code>.
