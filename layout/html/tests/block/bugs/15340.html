  GeForce should have the fastest fillrate of any shipping
  product this year. As for hardware T&amp;L, I don't know about you but I'm tired of my
  characters in games not having enough polygons to give me a realistic image. Think if we
  could build games that put as much geometry into the faces and expressions of characters
  as they do in just a few anatomical features of characters like Lara Croft.
