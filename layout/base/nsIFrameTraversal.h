/* Brief explanation of frame traversal types:
 *
 * LEAF:
 *  Iterate over only the leaf frames in the tree, in depth-first order.
 *
 * EXTENSIVE:
 *  Iterate over all frames in the tree, including non-leaf frames.
 *  Child frames are traversed before their parents going both forward
 *  and backward.
 *
 * FOCUS:
 *  Traverse frames in "focus" order, which is like extensive but
 *  does a strict preorder traversal in both directions.  This type of
 *  traversal also handles placeholder frames transparently, meaning that
 *  it will never stop on one - going down will get the real frame, going
 *  back up will go on past the placeholder, so the placeholders are logically
 *  part of the frame tree.
 *
 * FASTEST:
 *  XXX not implemented
 *
 * VISUAL:
 *  Traverse frames in "visual" order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
