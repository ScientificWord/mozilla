// <msqrt> -- form a fraction from two subexpressions 
//

/*
The MathML REC describes:

The <msqrt> element is used to display square roots.
The syntax for <msqrt> is:
  <msqrt> base </msqrt>

Attributes of <msqrt> and <mroot>:

None (except the attributes allowed for all MathML elements, listed in Section
2.3.4). 

The <mroot> element increments scriptlevel by 2, and sets displaystyle to
"false", within index, but leaves both attributes unchanged within base. The
<msqrt> element leaves both attributes unchanged within all its arguments.
These attributes are inherited by every element from its rendering environment,
but can be set explicitly only on <mstyle>. (See Section 3.3.4.)
