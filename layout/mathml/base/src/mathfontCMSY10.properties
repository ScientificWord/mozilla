# This file contains the list of all stretchy MathML chars that
# can be rendered with the indicated mathfont.
mathfont = CMSY10

# There is a nebulous entanglement between the parts of stretchy chars in
# TeX fonts. The convention used here is to enlist horizontal stretchy chars
# in the property file of cmsy, and enlist vertical stretchy chars in the
# property file of cmex. Exception: composite chars like under/over brace
# are all enlisted in cmex.
