 * Reflow status returned by the reflow methods. There are three

 *
 * NS_FRAME_COMPLETE means the frame is fully complete.
 *
 * NS_FRAME_NOT_COMPLETE bit flag means the frame does not map all its
 * content, and that the parent frame should create a continuing frame.
 * If this bit isn't set it means the frame does map all its content.
 * This bit is mutually exclusive with NS_FRAME_OVERFLOW_INCOMPLETE.
 *
 * NS_FRAME_OVERFLOW_INCOMPLETE bit flag means that the frame has
 * overflow that is not complete, but its own box is complete.
 * (This happens when content overflows a fixed-height box.)
 * The reflower should place and size the frame and continue its reflow,
 * but needs to create an overflow container as a continuation for this
 * frame. See nsContainerFrame.h for more information.
 * This bit is mutually exclusive with NS_FRAME_NOT_COMPLETE.
 * 
 * Please use the SET and MERGE macros below for handling
 * NS_FRAME_NOT_COMPLETE and NS_FRAME_OVERFLOW_INCOMPLETE.
 *
 * NS_FRAME_REFLOW_NEXTINFLOW bit flag means that the next-in-flow is
 * dirty, and also needs to be reflowed. This status only makes sense
 * for a frame that is not complete, i.e. you wouldn't set both
 * NS_FRAME_COMPLETE and NS_FRAME_REFLOW_NEXTINFLOW.
 *
 * The low 8 bits of the nsReflowStatus are reserved for future extensions;
 * the remaining 24 bits are zero (and available for extensions; however
 * API's that accept/return nsReflowStatus must not receive/return any
 * extension bits).
