/**
 * A reflow command is an object that is generated in response to a content
 * model change notification. The reflow command is given to a presentation
 * shell where it is queued and then dispatched by invoking the reflow
 * commands's Dispatch() member function.
 *
 * Reflow command processing follows a path from the root frame down to the
 * target frame (the frame for which the reflow command is destined). Reflow
 * commands are processed by invoking the frame's Reflow() member function.
 *
 * The typical flow of control for a given reflow command starts with a content
 * change notification. The content notifications are sent to document observers.
 * The presentation shell forwards the notifications to the style set. The style
 * system responds to the notifications by creating new frame (or destroying
 * existing frames) as appropriate, and then generating a reflow command.
