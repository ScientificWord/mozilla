/* atom list for CSS pseudo-elements */

/*
 * This file contains the list of nsIAtoms and their values for CSS
 * pseudo-elements.  It is designed to be used as inline input to
 * nsCSSPseudoElements.cpp *only* through the magic of C preprocessing.  All
 * entries must be enclosed either in the macro CSS_PSEUDO_ELEMENT or in the
 * macro CSS2_PSEUDO_ELEMENT; these macros will have cruel and unusual things
 * done to them.  The difference between the two macros is that the
 * pseudo-elements enclosed in CSS2_PSEUDO_ELEMENT are the pseudo-elements
 * which are allowed to have only a single ':' in stylesheets.  The entries
 * should be kept in some sort of logical order.  The first argument to all the
 * macros is the C++ identifier of the atom.  The second argument is the string
 * value of the atom.
 *
 * Code including this file MUST define CSS_PSEUDO_ELEMENT.  If desired, it can
 * also define CSS2_PSEUDO_ELEMENT to perform special handling of the CSS2
 * pseudo-elements.
