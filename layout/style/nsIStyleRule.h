/**
 * An object implementing |nsIStyleRule| (henceforth, a rule) represents
 * immutable stylistic information that either applies or does not apply
 * to a given element.  It belongs to an object or group of objects that
 * implement |nsIStyleSheet| and |nsIStyleRuleProcessor| (henceforth, a
 * sheet).
 *
 * A rule becomes relevant to the computation of style data when
 * |nsIStyleRuleProcessor::RulesMatching| creates a rule node that
 * points to the rule.  (A rule node, |nsRuleNode|, is a node in the
 * rule tree, which is a lexicographic tree indexed by rules.  The path
 * from the root of the rule tree to the |nsRuleNode| for a given
 * |nsStyleContext| contains exactly the rules that match the element
 * that the style context is for, in priority (weight, origin,
 * specificity) order.)
 *
 * The computation of style data uses the rule tree, which calls
 * |nsIStyleRule::MapRuleInfoInto| below.
 *
 * It is worth emphasizing that the data represented by a rule
 * implementation are immutable.  When the data need to be changed, a
 * new rule object must be created.  Failing to do this will lead to
 * bugs in the handling of dynamic style changes, since the rule tree
 * caches the results of |MapRuleInfoInto|.
 *
 * |nsIStyleRule| objects are owned by |nsRuleNode| objects (in addition
 * to typically being owned by their sheet), which are in turn garbage
 * collected (with the garbage collection roots being style contexts).
