This note describes the build-time parameters that determine which program gets built.

In the past, three parameters have been used, namely PROD_SWP, PROD_SW, and PROD_SNB. The differences are that SWP and SNB include the MuPAD computer algebra engine, and SW and SWP include TeX capabilities. There is a fourth possibility of having neither the computer algebra or the TeX capabilities. It is SNB without any computer algebra. MacKichan Software never offered such a product, but it can be built. Since it would have been the fourth product, I'll call it SN4 here.
