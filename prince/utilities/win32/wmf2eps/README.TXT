WMF2EPS 1.3 is shareware. 

NEW features of WMF2EPS 1.3
---------------------------

- WMF2EPS fully supports EMF format. However there are some limitations under 
  Win9x/ME due to the 16-bit GDI limitations (see WMF2EPS help file).
- WMF2EPS can add TIF previews (when registered).
- WMF2EPS has better printing support (center, crop marks, embedded PDF)

History
-------

Since WMF2EPS 0.3 was released in 1996, many users reported bugs or asked me to improve 
either the user interface, such as batch mode running from commandline, or similar.
WMF2EPS 0.3 was a real quick and dirty program without too much documentation, since it
was intended basically for personal use or for a few expert users.

The main reasons for those I've decided to release another versions of WMF2EPS are:

- Windows still lacks of EPS file support. 
- A lot of programs don't support EPS files properly. 
- Many users seem to use the program despite of its crude interface.

Installation 
------------
Please make sure you have the complete WMF2EPS 1.3 files 
(the ZIP archive WMF2EPS1.3.ZIP as found under http://www.wmf2eps.de.vu).

I recommend to have GhostView installed for viewing the EPS files installed together with 
WMF2EPS. GhostView can be obtained from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost.

If you have Windows 95,98 or ME, I also recommend getting Adobes enhanced PS driver for Win 9x.Version 4.26 can be obtaind from 

ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/printerdrivers/win/aps426eng.exe

or the universal (for all current Windows versions) PS Printer driver archive 

ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/printerdrivers/win/1.x/winsteng.exe

1. Unpack WMF2EPS from the ZIP archive to any directory, where you have write permission.
2. Install the PS driver (see the Help File for details).
3. Start WMF2EPS and test your installation (see the Help File for details).
