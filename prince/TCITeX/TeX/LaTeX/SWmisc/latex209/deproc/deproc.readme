DEPROC -- A TeX Header for Formatting DECUS Proceedings Articles


DEPROC is a package that will format articles for the DECUS Pro-
ceedings.  It can be used by anyone who has access to the TeX
typesetting system.  DEPROC is a TeX header (macro package).


The DECUS Proceedings have traditionally been published from copy
supplied by the authors, prepared according to rules devised for
typewritten material.  The power of the computer typesetting language
TeX has now been applied to this task, and a formatting package, named
DEPROC, has been submitted to the DECUS Program Library for use by
authors who have access to a working TeX system.  (The TeX program and
related software, created by Donald Knuth of Stanford, are in the
public domain.)

The documentation (which was itself produced by the DEPROC package--
see file DEPROCDOC.TEX) presents the important features of DEPROC and,
through examples, shows how it is to be used.  Use of DEPROC, which is
encouraged, will produce the author's work, nicely typeset, in the
standard Proceedings format.  There is a general description of how
the package works and of the mechanical requirements for camera copy
of Proceedings articles, which will be created on the author's local
output device.

No prior knowledge of TeX is required, but authors using DEPROC will
be expected to learn some rudiments, especially if their papers
contain special notation or formats such as tables.  A sample table
appears in DEPROCDEV.TEX and DEPROCDEV.FIL, the files used to prepare
a table of output devices which have been interfaced to DEC computers.
