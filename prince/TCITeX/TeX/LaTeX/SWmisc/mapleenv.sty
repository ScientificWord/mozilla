%
% This latex style file defines environments suitable for 
% processing the latex documents exported from Maple worksheets.
% In particular, it defines each of:
%
%   maple commands,   \begin{mapleinput}...\end{mapleinput}, 
%
%   maple text output, \begin{maplettyout}...\end{maplettyout}, 
%
%   maple generated latex, \begin{maplelatex}...\end{maplelatex}
% 
%   maple separator lines, \maplesepline
%
%   maple plots , \mapleplot{filename}
%
% The mapleinput, and maplettyout environments are similar to 
% \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim} in effect.  
% but there are several important differences.
%
% - the spacing relative to the surrounding environment is different.
%
% - page breaks are encourages before commands, or after results.
%
% - maplettyout and maplelatex environments are assumed to follow
% mapleinput regions and so have less space above.  This allows us to
% reduce the space between adjacent Maple regions without any
% elaborate mechanism to detect when there have been intervening
% paragraphs of text.
%
% - the size of the font for text regions is definable.
%
% - the  indentation of the environments can be indented by setting 
% the value of \LeftMapleSkip  .
%
% The current definition of \mapleplot is appropriate for use with 
% the psfig macros and has been tested with psfig Version 1.9. It
% assumes that the plot is in landscape mode, but parameters can be
% changed to deal with rotation, etc.
%%
% J. S. Devitt,  February, 1994.
%
% The User Definable parameters are
% \AboveMaplePlot	- space above a Maple Plot 
% \BelowMaplePlot	- space below a Maple Plot
% \MaplePlotHeight	- vertical space reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotWidth	- width reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotAngle	- angle of rotatation
% \AboveMapleSkip	- space above an environment
% \BelowMapleSkip	- space below an environment
% \LeftMapleSkip 	- the amount of left indentation
% \MapleFont 		- The Maple font 
% \MapleSize 		- The size of the Maple font 
% \MapleFirstLine	- controls ingoring first line feed
% \MaplePrompttrue 	- controls insertion of prompt char
% \MaplePromptString	- defines the prompt character
% \MapleSkip		- amount of glue before and after
%			displayed text
% \MapleTab		- number of spaces per tab (8)
% \MapleParCount	- counter used to detect adjacent Maple
%			regions.
