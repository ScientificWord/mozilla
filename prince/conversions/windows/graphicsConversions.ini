; WINDOWS VERSION
; This file lists the graphics file extensions that are understood by Scientific WorkPlace,
; Scientific Word, and Scientific Notebook.
;
; Graphics formats that are not understood by the underlying Mozilla base or implemented by
; a plugin must first be converted to a form that can be displayed.
;
; The [Converters] section gives, for each extension, the command string that does the conversion.
; We count SVG and EPS as acceptable formats because with the right packages, they work with pdfTeX and
; XeTeX. Actually, we convert EPS to PDF, since it is more efficient to do it once rather than for each compilation.
;
; Users that want to experiment with adding support for new graphics formats can add additional lines to
; these sections. We assume that all conversion programs, including convert and sam2p, are in the
; utilities subdirectory or one in the PATH environment variable set in MSITeX.bash.

; $1 stands for the base name of the original file (the full path without the extension).
; $2 stands for the leaf name (without the extension) of the original file.
; $3 stands for the desired width of the converted image.
; $4 stands for the desired height of the converted image.
; $M stands for the full path of the MSITeX.bash or MSITeX.cmd file which is a sibling of the utilities directory.
; $D stands for the full path of the _work directory (parent of graphics, gcache, and tcache).

; extensions with no text following the '=' are directly viewable in the program, and do not need to be
; converted. The '<extension>=' part is needed, though, to show that the extension is acceptable.
; We use commas instead of spaces to separate parameters, because otherwise spaces in paths can cause a problem.
