<h3 id="creating_a_new_page">Creating a New Page</h3>

<p>&brandShortName; is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) editor that
allows you to create and edit web pages. &brandShortName; is a
<em>WYSIWYG</em> (What You See Is What You Get) editor, so you can
display how your page will look to the reader as you're creating
it. It is not necessary for you to know HTML, since most of the basic
HTML functions are available as commands from the toolbars and
menus.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; also lets you edit the HTML source if you want. To
view or edit the HTML source code, open the View menu, and choose HTML
Source, or click the &lt;HTML&gt; Source tab in the Edit Mode toolbar
at the bottom of the &brandShortName; window.</p>

<p>To create a web page, use one of the methods described below.  Once
you've started a page, you can add and edit text just as you would in
a word processor.</p>

<p><strong>To create a new page in &brandShortName;</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the New button in &brandShortName;'s toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To start from an HTML file stored on your local
drive</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Window menu and choose &brandShortName;. You see the
  &brandShortName; window.</li>

  <li>Open the File menu and choose Open File. You see the Open HTML
  File dialog box.</li>

  <li>On your local drive, locate the file that you want to edit.</li>

  <li>Click Open to display the specified file in a &brandShortName;
  window.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To edit a web page</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open &brandShortName;</li> <li>Click on File menu and choose
  Open Web Location. You will see the Open Web Location dialog box.</li>

  <li>Type in the URL of the page to edit (for example,
  <tt>http://www.mozilla.org</tt>) and click Create button. You will see
  the page displayed in &brandShortName;.</li> 
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In the &brandShortName; window you can
quickly open the most recent file you've been working on by opening
the File menu, choosing Recent Pages, and then selecting the file you
want from the list.</p>

<p>[ <a href="#starting_a_new_page">Return to beginning of section</a>
]</p>

<h3 id="saving_and_browsing_your_new_page">Saving and Browsing Your
New Page</h3>

<p>You can save &brandShortName; documents in HTML or text-only
format.  Saving a document in HTML format preserves the document's
formatting, such as text styles (for example, bold or italic), tables,
links, and images. Saving a document in text-only format removes all
the HTML tags but preserves the document's text.</p>

<p>To save a document as an HTML file:</p>

<ul> 
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Save or click the Save button
  on the Composition toolbar.

  <p>If you haven't already given your page a title, &brandShortName;
  prompts you to do so. &brandShortName; displays the page title in the
  browser window's title bar when you view the page in the browser. The
  document's page title also appears in your list of bookmarks if you
  bookmark the page.</p>

  <p>&brandShortName; then prompts you to enter a filename and specify
  the location where you want to save the file. Make sure you preserve
  the .html extension in the filename.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To change the filename or location of an existing HTML file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose Save As and select a different filename or
  location.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you save a page in &brandShortName;, all parts of the page
(the HTML, images and other files, such as sound files and style
sheets), are saved locally on your hard drive. If you only want to
save the HTML part of the page, you must change the &brandShortName;
preference for saving pages. See <a
href="#composer_preferences">&brandShortName; Preferences</a> for more
information on changing &brandShortName;'s setting for saving
pages.</p>

<p>If an image location is absolute (starts with "http://") and you
are connected to the Internet, you will still see that image in the
document in &brandShortName; and Navigator. However, if the image
location is relative to the page location (starts with "file:///"),
then you won't see the image in the local version of the document.</p>

<p>To save a document as a text-only file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Export to Text.</li>

  <li>Enter the filename and specify the location where you want to save
  the file.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Images do not appear in documents saved in
the text-only format.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can choose Revert from the File menu to
retrieve the most recently saved copy of the document in which you're
working. Keep in mind that your current changes will be lost.</p>

<p>To view your page in a browser window in order to test your
links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Browse Page (or click Browse in
  the Composition toolbar). If you have not yet saved your document,
  &brandShortName; prompts you to enter a page title, filename, and
  location.  The &brandShortName; window remains open behind the new
  Navigator window.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="formatting_paragraphs_heading_and_lists">Formatting
Paragraphs, Headings, and Lists</h3>

<p>To apply a format to a paragraph, begin from the &brandShortName;
window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the format
  to begin, or select the text you want to format.</li>

  <li>Choose a paragraph format using the drop-down list in the Format
  toolbar:</li>

  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
      list-style-image: none;"> <ul> <li><strong>Body Text</strong>: Applies
      the application default font and style for regular text, without
      affecting the spacing before or after the text.</li>

      <li><strong>Paragraph</strong>: Inserts a paragraph tag (use this to
      begin a new paragraph). The paragraph includes top and bottom
      margins.</li>

      <li><strong>Heading 1</strong> - <strong>Heading 6</strong>: Formats
      the paragraph as a heading. Heading 1 is the highest-level heading,
      while Heading 6 is the lowest-level heading.</li>

      <li><strong>Address</strong>: Can be used for a web page "signature"
      that indicates the author of the page and the person to contact for
      more information, for example: <tt>user@example.com</tt>

      <p>You might want to include the date and a copyright notice. This
      format usually appears at the bottom of the web page under a
      horizontal line. Navigator displays the address format in italics.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Preformat</strong>: This is useful for elements such as
      code examples, column data, and mail messages that you want displayed
      in a fixed-width font. In normal text, most browsers remove extra
      spaces, tabs, and paragraph returns. However, text that uses the
      Preformatted style is displayed with the white space intact,
      preserving the layout of the original text.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To format text as a heading:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point anywhere within the text
  that you want to format.</li>

  <li>Using the drop-down list in the Format toolbar, choose the level
  of heading you want, from 1 (largest) to 6 (smallest). Choose "Heading
  1" for your main heading, "Heading 2" for the next level, and so
  forth.</li>
</ol>

<p>To apply a list item format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the line of text
  that you want to format.</li>

  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List.</li>

  <li>Choose the list style:</li>

  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
      list-style-image: none;"> <ul> <li><strong>Bulleted</strong>: Each
      item has a bullet (dot) next to it (as in this list).</li>

      <li><strong>Numbered</strong>: Items are numbered.</li>

      <li><strong>Term</strong> and <strong>Definition</strong>: These two
      styles work together, creating a glossary-style appearance. Use the
      Term tag for the word being defined, and the Definition tag for the
      definition. The Term text appears flush left, and the Definition text
      appears indented.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can quickly apply a list style to a block
of text by selecting the text
and clicking the Numbered List

<img src="images/numbers.gif" width="21" height="21" alt="" />
or Bulleted List
<img src="images/bullets.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />
buttons on the Format toolbar.</p>

<p>To change the style of bullets or numbers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the text of the
  list item you want to change, or select one or more items in the list
  if you want to apply a new style to the entire list.</li>

  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List Properties.</li>

  <li>Select a bullet or number style from the drop-down list. For
  numbered lists, you can specify a starting number. For bulleted lists,
  you can change the bullet style.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also double-click on a bullet or
number in a list to display the List Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>To align a paragraph or text in your page, for example, centering
or aligning to the left or right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the paragraph or
  line of text you want to align.</li>

  <li>Open the Format menu and choose Align; then choose an alignment
  option.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also use the Format toolbar to align
text.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a

<h3 id="changing_text_color_style_and_font">Changing Text Color,
Style, and Font</h3>

<p>To change the style, color, or font of selected text:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the text you want to format.</li>

  <li>Open the Format menu and choose one of the following:</li>

  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
      list-style-image: none;">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Font</strong>: Use this to
      choose a font. If you prefer to use fonts specified by the reader's
      browser, select Variable Width or Fixed Width.

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all fonts installed on your computer
      appear.  Instead of specifying a font that may not be available to all
      who view your web page, it's generally best to select one of the fonts
      provided in the menu since these fonts work on every computer. For
      example, the fonts Helvetica, Arial, Times, and Courier generally look
      the same when viewed on different computers. If you select a different
      font, it may not look the same when viewed using a different
      computer.</p> </li>

      <li><strong>Size</strong>: Use this to choose a <em>relative</em> font
      size or select an option to increase or decrease text size (relative
      to the surrounding text).</li>

      <li><strong>Text Style</strong>: Use this to select a style, such as
      italic, bold, or underline, or to apply a structured style, for
      example, Code.</li>

      <li><strong>Text Color</strong>: Use this to choose a color from the
      color picker. If you are familiar with HTML hexadecimal color codes,
      you can type a specific code or you can just type a color name (for
      example, "blue"). You'll find a handy color code converter <a
      href="http://builder.cnet.com/webbuilding/pages/QuickReference/Color/converter.html?tag=st.bl.7650.ref_l.bl_converter"
      target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>To change the background color of the page:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click anywhere in the page.</li>

  <li>Click the background color block in the Format toolbar.</li>

  <li>Choose a background color from the Block Background Color dialog
  box.</li>

  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To quickly change the color of text to the
color last used, select the text, then press Shift and click on the
text color block in the Format toolbar. This is useful when you want
to use one color for separate lines of text.</p>

<p>You can also use an image as a background. See <a

<h3 id="validating_the_html">Validating the HTML</h3>

<p>Before you put your document on a web server so that others can see
it, you should first check the document's HTML formatting to make sure
it conforms to web standards. Documents containing validated HTML are
less likely to cause problems when viewed by different browsers. Just
visually checking your web pages in Navigator doesn't ensure that your
document will appear correctly when viewed in other web browsers.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; provides a convenient way for you to check that
your document conforms to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) HTML
standards. &brandShortName; uses the W3C HTML Validation Service,
which checks your document's HTML syntax for compliance with HTML 4.01
standards.  This service also provides information on how to correct
errors.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be connected to the Internet to use
this feature.</p>

<p>To validate your document's HTML syntax:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu, and choose Validate HTML. If you have
  unsaved changes, &brandShortName; asks you to save them before
  proceeding.</li>

  <li>&brandShortName; will open another window with results for your
  page displayed in it after the W3C Validation Service program parses
  your html file.</li>

<h3 id="choosing_the_right_editing_mode">Choosing the Right Editing
Mode</h3>

<p>Typically, you won't need to change the editing mode from the
default (Normal). However, if you want to work with the document's
HTML source code, you may want to change editing modes.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; allows you to quickly switch between four editing
modes or views. Each editing mode allows you to continue working on
your document, but displays varying levels of HTML tags (and tag
icons).</p>

<p>Before you choose an editing mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the View menu, choose Show/Hide, and then make sure
  there is a checkmark next to Edit Mode Toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Edit Mode toolbar has four tabs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Normal</strong>: Choose this editing mode to see how
  the document will look online while you are creating it. Choose this
  mode to show table borders and named anchor icons. All other HTML tag
  icons are hidden.</li>

  <li><strong>Show All Tags</strong>: Choose this mode to show all HTML
  tag icons.</li>

  <li><strong>&lt;HTML&gt; Source</strong>: Choose this mode to view and
  edit the document as unformatted HTML source code. When you save the
  document, the Normal mode reappears.</li>

  <li><strong>Preview</strong>: Choose this mode to display and edit the
  document exactly as it would appear in a browser window, except that
  links and JavaScript functions will not be active.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: JavaScript functions, frames, links, Java,
embedded objects and animated GIF files are not active in any of the
editing modes. To display these items in their active state, click the
Browse button on the Composition toolbar to load the page into a
browser window.</p>

<h3 id="using_status_bar_for_formatting_your_web_page">Using Status
Bar for Formatting Your Web Page</h3>

<p>&brandShortName; has an innovative feature of editing/applying
inline styles and applying class or id tags to selected text via its
status bar. Styling using the status bar is possible in all modes
except <strong>&lt;HTML&gt; Source</strong> viewing mode.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> Clicking on "Select" will select the
entire text bounded by the style tag.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Tag</strong> Clicking on "Remove Tag" will remove
the style tag, and in turn all the styles for that tag will be
removed.</li>

  <li><strong>Change Tag</strong> Using this option, the user can
change the tag used for the text with the least effort. Clicking on
"Change Tag" makes the text for the corresponding tag to be editable
in the status bar. Type in the desired tag and press "Enter". The
default properties of the tag will be applied to the text in the web
page.</li>

  <li><strong>Inline Styles</strong>While in any of the Normal, HTML Tags, or Preview viewing modes the tags surrounding the current position of the cursor are shown in the
  status bar of &brandShortName;'s window. Style properties of any of
  the tags can be changed by choosing an option from the context
  menu. To change inline style properties:

  <ol>
    <li>Right click on the tag you wish to edit.</li>
    <li>Click on "Inline Styles" </li>
    <li>Select the properties section you want to edit:

corresponding tab section from CaScadeS CSS editor (more about
CaScadeS in <a href="#using_style_sheets_for_your_web_pages">Using

Your Web Pages</h2>

<h3 id="using_cascade_style_sheets">Using Cascade Style Sheets</h3>

<p>Cascade Style Sheets(CSS) can be used to style an HTML document in
three ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using inline styles.</li>

  <li>Using internal style sheet.</li>

  <li>Using external style sheets.</li>
</ol>

<p>&brandShortName; has an inbuilt style sheet editor called
<strong>CaScadeS</strong>. CaScadeS can be used to produce either an
internal style sheet or an external one. As opposed to inline styles,
internal or external style sheets help to keep the content and style
information separate.</p>

<p>To style the html document you are editing, CaScadeS can be started
by clicking on Tools and choosing CSS Editor. CaScadeS allows two
modes of style sheet editing:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Beginner Mode</strong>: This mode allows to create
  rules associated to class selectors or type element selectors.</li>

  <li><strong>Expert Mode</strong>: This mode allows to create rules
  without any restriction.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case there is no style sheet, a new style sheet will be
automatically created.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#using_style_sheets_for_your_web_pages">Return to beginning of

<h3 id="creating_style_sheets_with_&brandShortName;">Creating Style

<p>Using CaScadeS, one can create either internal style sheets or
external style sheets. To create an internal style sheet:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on Style elt. button
  <ul>
    <li>(Optional) Media list and Title can also be filled in.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Click on Create Stylesheet.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create an external stylesheet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on Link elt. button</li>

  <li>Fill in the URL of the stylesheet in the right pane. A new file
  with be created on the local filesystem, if it doesnot already exist.

  <ul>
    <li>(Optional) Media list and Title can also be filled in.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Check the "check to create alternate stylesheet" if this is an
  alternate one.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always save the html document before
attaching local style sheet.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use Refresh
button in the left pane, if stylesheet is not immediately
downloaded.</p>

wherever needed. This allows you to delete one or more cells but still
maintain the table's original rectangular layout, or
structure. Otherwise, deleting cells can result in a table with empty
spaces, or whose outline appears irregular due to an uneven number of
cells.</p>

<p>To change the default table editing behavior, begin from the
&brandShortName; window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X), choose
  Preferences, and then choose &brandShortName;.</li>

  <li>Under Table Editing, set the following preference:

  <ul>
    <li>Make sure that "Maintain table layout when inserting or
    deleting cells" is checked to ensure that you don't get an irregularly

these steps:</p>

<p>To edit the properties for a selected image:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Double-click the image, or select it and click the Image button
  <img src="images/image.gif" width="23" height="25" alt="" /> on

    location of the image file. Click
    Choose File to search for an image file on your hard drive
    or network.</li>
    
    <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If checked,
    &brandShortName; converts the URL to
    be relative to the page's location. This is especially
    useful if you plan to publish
    your pages on a web server so that others can view
    them. Using relative URLs allows
    you to keep all your linked files in the same place relative
    to each other, regardless
    of their location on your hard disk or a web server.
    <p>Unchecking this box causes &brandShortName; to convert the
    URL to a full (absolute) URL.
    You typically use absolute URLs when linking to images on
    other web servers
    (not stored locally on your hard disk).</p>
    <p>If you have never saved or published the page, you must first
    save the page in
    order to enable this checkbox. (This checkbox is not
    available if you open the Image
    Properties dialog box in a message compose
    window.)</p></li>

    <li><strong>Alternate Text</strong>: Enter text that will display
    in place of the original image;
    for example, a caption or a brief description of the
    image. It's a good practice to
    specify alternate text for readers who use text-only web
    browsers or who have image
    loading turned off.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Don't use alternate text</strong>: Choose this option
    if the image does not
    require alternate text or if you don't want to include
    it.</li>
    
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Dimensions tab to edit these properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Actual Size</strong>: Select this option to undo any

<h3 id="adding_table_of_contents_to_your_web_page">Adding Table of
Contents to Your Web Page</h3>

<p>For an html document having different sections, e.g. an article
with sections and subsections and headings for each section and
subsection, it becomes difficult to navigate if all the text is in a
single file. To enable easy navigation of different sections, a Table
of Contents (TOC) can be generated easily with Nvu. To generate a TOC
for an html document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the html heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6) to label
  different levels of sections and subsections in the document. And save
  the document.</li>

  <li>Click on "Insert", "Table of Contents" and choose "Insert". The
  TOC window will appear.</li>

  <li>Select the levels of headings used for differet sections and
  subsections in the document.</li>
  
  <li>Click "OK" to build the TOC.</li>
</ol>

<p>The TOC generated by default shows all entries as numbered and they
are anchored links to respective sections. Unchecking the "Number all
entries in table of contents" checkbox results in bulleted section
entries. And checking "Make the table of contents read only" results
in sections being simple text without anchors.</p>

<p>To create a link within the same page, for example a link that the
reader can use to
jump from one section to another, you must create an <em>anchor</em>
(target location),
and then create a link that points to the anchor. Anchors are also
called
<em>named anchors</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point at the beginning of a line
  where you want to
  create an anchor, or select some text.</li>
  
  <li>Open the Insert menu and choose Named Anchor. You see the Named
  Anchor Properties
  dialog box.</li>
  
  <li>Type a unique name for the anchor in the Anchor Name field (up
  to 30 characters).
  If you include spaces, they will be converted to underscores ( _
  ). If you selected
  some text in step 1, this box already contains a name.</li>
  
  <li>Click OK. An anchor icon appears in your document to mark the
  anchor's location:
  <img src="images/anchor-in-doc.gif" width="20" height="17" alt=""
  /></li>
</ol>

<p>To create the link on which readers can click to jump to the
anchor:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the text or image that you want to link to the
  anchor.</li>

  <li>Click the Link button or open the Insert menu and choose
  Link. You see the Link
  Properties dialog box.
  
  <ul>
    <li>If you're creating a link to an HTML file on your computer,
    click Choose File
    to locate it.</li>
    
    <li>If you're creating a link to a named anchor (target), select
    it from the list of
    the anchors currently available in the page.</li>
    
    <li>If you're creating a link to a level heading (for example,
    Heading 1 - Heading 6),
    select it from the list of headings currently available in
    the page.</li>
    
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Click OK.</li> 
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To test the link you just created, open the
File menu and choose Browse Page,
then click the link.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you did not first create named anchors,
you can use the Link dialog box to
create links to headings that already occur in the page.</p>

    filename for a local file,
    click Choose File to look for it on your hard disk or
    network. For remote URLs, you
    can copy the URL from the browser location
    field. Alternatively, you can select a
    named anchor or a heading in the current page that you
    want to link to.</li>

  <li>Click the &brandShortName; category.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum number of pages listed:</strong> Specify the
  maximum number of pages that are listed under Recent Pages in the File
  menu.</li>

  <li><strong>Retain original source formatting</strong>: This option
  preserves line breaks and the page's original formatting for the HTML
  source code. Select this if you want to preserve white space (extra
  lines, tabs, etc.) that makes the HTML source code more readable. This
  preference does not affect how your pages appear in a browser
  window.</li>

  <li><strong>Reformat HTML source</strong>: This option reformats the
  HTML source code to make it more readable, by inserting line breaks
  and indentation. This preference does not affect how your pages appear
  in a browser window.</li>

  <li><strong>Save images and other associated files when saving
  pages</strong>: If checked, all images, JavaScript (JS), Cascading
  Style Sheet (CSS), and other associated files are saved in the same
  location as the document when the document is saved for the first time
  or when the document is saved to a new location. If unchecked, only
  the HTML file is saved.</li>

  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
      list-style-image: none;"> <p>For example, when editing a remote page,
      this setting ensures that all related files associated with the remote
      page will be saved locally when you save the page to your hard
  disk.</p> </li>

  <li><strong>Always show Publish dialog when publishing pages</strong>:
  If checked, &brandShortName; always displays the Publish Page dialog
  box when you click the Publish button or choose Publish from the File
  menu.  If not checked, &brandShortName; only displays the Publish Page
  dialog box if it needs more information in order to publish the

  <li><strong>Maintain table layout when inserting or deleting
  cells</strong>: Select this if you want &brandShortName; to always
  preserve the table's layout (that is, keep it in a rectangular shape)
  by adding cells where needed. If you deselect this option, when you
  delete one or more cells, &brandShortName; removes the cell border as
  well, which can result in a table with empty spaces, or an outline
  that appears irregular due to an uneven number of cells.</li>

  <!-- Don't know why the list styling is done like this for CSS
       option. Moving to normal styling --> <!--li id="use_css_syles"
       style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;

       elements and attributes</strong>: Enables the use of Cascading Style
       Sheet (CSS) formatting in your &brandShortName; documents. With this
       preference enabled, &brandShortName; generates HTML 4.01 formatting
       with CSS inline styles for elements.</li>

       <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
	   list-style-image: none;">

	 <p>If this preference is not enabled, &brandShortName; generates HTML
	 4.01 formatting, but does not use CSS styles.</p>

	 <p>Compared to HTML, HTML with CSS formatting is more portable, more
	 maintainable, and more compatible when viewed with different
	 browsers. If you enable this preference and then edit a document
	 created without CSS, &brandShortName; replaces the edited elements
	 with CSS styles.</p>

	 <p>If you enable CSS styles, you can choose a text highlight color for
	 selected text using the text highlight color button on the Format
	 toolbar. You can also choose a color background for any element on the
	 page. (These features are not available if this preference is not
       enabled.)</p> </li>

Preferences - Advanced Settings (Return Key Behaviour)</h3>

<p>The option "Return in a paragraph always creates new paragraph"
defines the behaviour of the return key. Choosing it creates a new
paragraph if you hit the "Return" key while typing in a
paragraph. Without this option &lt;br&gt; tags are added for carriage
returns.</p>
