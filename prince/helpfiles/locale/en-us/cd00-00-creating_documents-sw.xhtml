<sectiontitle>LaTeX Typesetting</sectiontitle>
<bodyText>
Version 6 of SWP and SW enables both professionals and support staff to produce 
beautifully typeset text and mathematics, adhering to internationally accepted 
standards. Stunning books and articles can be produced without the author having 
to know TeX or LaTeX, the industry standard for mathematics typesetting. The 
resulting LaTeX files can be submitted electronically to many journals. The 
program includes many document shells that have been designed to meet the 
typesetting requirements of specific journals and institutions. Recent advances 
in TeX and LaTeX, including XeTeX, are included in Version 6. SNB does not 
produce typeset output.

LaTeX files to PDF creating fully hyperlinked documents with embedded graphics. 
Using SWP, SW, or SNB you can also export web pages.</bodyText><bodyText> You 
can easily build an entire website with mathematical content which can be read 
with any web browser, such as Firefox, that displays MathML.
