    <bodyText>Understanding the notation and the terms used in our documentation will help you understand
      the instructions. We assume you're familiar with the basic procedures and
      terminology for your operating system. In our manuals, we use the notation
      and terms listed below.

      <sectiontitle><shortTitle>Keyboard</shortTitle>Keyboard Conventions</sectiontitle>

      <bodyText>We use standard computer conventions to give keyboard instructions.
      </bodyText>
      <bodyText>The <notewrapper xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><note type="marginpar" id="tsid_3141643"><bodyText><QTR type="QQQMarginheading">Macintosh
        Users Note</QTR></bodyText></note></notewrapper> 
        names of keys in the instructions match the names shown on most keyboards. 
        Ctrl (Windows) and command (Mac) are synonymous, as are Alt (Windows) and option (Mac), and Enter (Windows) and return (Mac). 
        <strong>Names of keys are always shown in Windows format.</strong>
        Macintosh users should substitute Mac keys (e.g. command, option, and return) as appropriate.
        For right-clicking, Macintosh users with a single-button mouse should substitute
        control+click.
      </bodyText>

      <bodyText>A plus sign (+) between the names of two
        keys indicates that you must press the first key and hold it down while
        you press the second key. For example, Ctrl+g means that you press and hold
        down the Ctrl key, press g, and then release both keys.
      </bodyText>

      <bodyText>Press the Alt key followed by the indicated letter(s) (F for File, S for Save,
        e.g.) to quickly access menus and commands. Press Esc to cancel.
      </bodyText>

      <bodyText>Press <notewrapper xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><note type="marginpar" id="tsid_3141644"><bodyText>
        <QTR type="QQQMarginheading">Important:</QTR><br/>
        <sansSerif>Terminating Lists, Subsections, etc.</sansSerif></bodyText></note></notewrapper> 
        Enter in an empty paragraph to terminate any structure (subsection, list, etc.)
        and return to the next level up. (Pressing Enter twice is the same.) 
        This does mean that you can't ordinarily press Enter multiple times to create
        white space. To create vertical space, either use Insert &#8594; Spacing objects... &#8594; Vertical space... 
        OR use Configuration to change how pressing Enter in an empty paragraph works.

    <sectiontitle><shortTitle>Mouse</shortTitle>Mouse Conventions</sectiontitle>

    <bodyText>The instructions in this manual assume you have not changed any mouse button
      defaults. You can use the right mouse button to display a Context menu for
      the current selection or the item under the mouse pointer. (Mac Users: control+click.)
      Pressing the Application key or Command key also displays the menu.
    </bodyText>

    <bodyText>In any dialog box, click the OK button to put changes into effect and dismiss the dialog
      box. Click the Cancel button to dismiss the dialog box without taking any
      other action. You may also click the Close button in the upper right corner of the dialog
      box.
