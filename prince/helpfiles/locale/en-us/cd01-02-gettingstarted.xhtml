<sectiontitle>For New Users</sectiontitle> 
<bodyText>One of the most important
things to understand when using MacKichan products is the difference between
semantic and formative tagging. Most people are used to the latter: You
wish to emphasize a word, so you select it and choose bold, italics, underline,
or some other format option. In 
Scientific Workplace
 (SWP), however, you select the text and apply a meaningful tag; say, "Emphasis."
The exact way the text is displayed is independent of this tagging. It could
be changed at production time to suit different requirements:
italics for print, bold for the Web, underline for a screenplay, etc. </bodyText>
<bodyText>Working
this way, you don't have to go back and retag everything that you might
have tagged "italic" if you need for it to be underlined; you simply change
how the tag "Emphasis" is printed and displayed. One change instead of many.
The logical separation of the creative process of writing documents from
the mechanical process of formatting them has always been at the heart of
the user interface in 
Scientific Workplace
 (SWP) and 
Scientific Word
 (SW). </bodyText>
<bodyText>As you write, the tags you apply to your content
not only establish the document's structure but also consistently define
its printed, online, or typeset appearance, all according to the properties
associated with each tag. Tag properties are determined by the document's
style, a collection of commands that define the way the document appears
when you display it on the screen or in a browser, and when you produce
it without typesetting. In SWP and SW, tag properties are also determined
by the document's typesetting specifications. </bodyText>
<bodyText>While
you are doing the work of creating content, you do not need to be distracted
by formatting tasks. The program does that work for you. In other words,
while you do the work of creating a good document, the program does the
work of creating a beautiful one. And with so many available output options,
each with a different purpose and appearance, taking the time-consuming
approach of trying to make the document on the screen look as much as possible
like the document in print is simply not necessary. </bodyText>
<bodyText>Because
the document window doesn't correspond directly to the size of online or
printed pages, the program doesn't display page divisions or fixed line
lengths on the screen; lines are broken to fit the size of the window. If
you resize the window, the program reshapes the text to fit it. When you
preview your document, you'll see the page divisions correctly. </bodyText>
<bodyText>MacKichan
products share an easy-to-use scientific word processor that accepts mathematics
entered using familiar mathematical notation on the same screen as text.
The programs use styles and tags for formatting documents, which can be
printed directly or saved as <texb enc="1" name="XHTML"><![CDATA[\XHTML{}]]></texb>
files for use on your website. Version 6 provides direct access to the Internet
from within the program. The online Help system provides fast information
when you need it. SWP and SW support typesetting with <texlogo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</texlogo>,
<texb enc="1" name="pdfLaTeX"><![CDATA[\pdfLaTeX{}]]></texb> or <texb enc="1" name="XeTeX"><![CDATA[\XeTeX{}]]></texb>,
as well as direct printing without typesetting. SWP and 
Scientific Notebook 
(SNB) support a wide range of symbolic and numeric mathematical <indexitem req="varioref"><prisec>computation!MuPAD</prisec></indexitem>computations
with MuPAD, including plotting and animation of various two- and three-dimensional
expressions, computing with named physical units, and performing dynamic
calculations with formula objects. </bodyText>
