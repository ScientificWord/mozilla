<h1 id="help_window_top">Using the Help Window</h1>

<p>This section describes how to use the Help window (the entire window in
  which this text and the Sidebar on the left are displayed).</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#finding_the_topic_you_want">Finding the Topic You Want</a></li>
    <li><a href="#retracing_your_steps">Retracing Your Steps</a></li>
    <li><a href="#search_tips">Search Tips</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="finding_the_topic_you_want">Finding the Topic You Want</h2>

	<p>When you're viewing the Help window, click the tabs in the left frame to view
	  the Help contents in different ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Contents</strong> shows the list of main topics.<br/>
		  Click a topic to read about it. Double-click to see its subtopics.</li>
		 <li><strong>Search</strong> lets you search the Help files.<br/>
		  Type a word or phrase and press Enter to see related topics. Then click
		  the topic you want to read about.<br/><br/>
		  If your search doesn't return any topics, try typing fewer words or a
		  different combination of words.</li>
		 <li><strong>Index</strong> lists topics alphabetically.<br/>Click an index entry
		 to view information on that topic.</li>
		 <li><strong>Glossary</strong> lists definitions alphabetically.<br/>Click
		 a glossary term to see its definition.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To see information related to the Help topic you are reading, click
	  links in the Help window just as you would in a regular web page.</p>

<h2 id="retracing_your_steps">Retracing Your Steps</h2>
	<p>To retrace your steps in Help, click the buttons near the top left corner of
	  the Help window:</p>

	<p><img src="chrome://help/content/help-buttons.png" alt="" width="209" height="43"/></p>

	<ul>
	        <li>Click the Show/Hide Sidebar button to show and hide the Sidebar contained
	          on the left side of the Help Window.</li>
		<li>Click the Back button to move back through pages you have previously
		  visited. It works just like the Back button in the main &brandShortName;
		  window.</li>
		<li>Click the Forward button to move forward through pages you have previously
		  visited. It works just like the Forward button in the main &brandShortName;
		  window.</li>
		<li>Click the Home button to see the Help and Support Center, which includes
		  links to support options and web-based resources.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Alternatively, print the instructions you want to follow:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To print the whole page that's currently displayed in the Help window,
		  click the Print button near the top-right corner of the Help window:<br/>

		<img src="chrome://help/content/print.png" alt="" width="38" height="43"/></li>

		<li>To print just a portion of the page, first click and drag to select the
		  area you want to print and then click the Print button.</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="search_tips">Search Tips</h2>
	<p>If you aren't finding what you want in your search, here are a few helpful tips:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Be sure that you are searching for something that relates to
		  &brandShortName;; this is not a general Internet search.</li>
        	<li>Try to broaden your search - don't be too specific; terms
		  could be worded differently than your search.</li>
		<li>Avoid being too broad with your search: words like &quot;&brandShortName;&quot;
		  and &quot;&vendorShortName;&quot; could possibly return all of the pages in the help file.</li>
	</ul>
