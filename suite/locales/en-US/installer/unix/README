                 SeaMonkey Read Me

====================================================

SeaMonkey is subject to the terms detailed in the license agreement accompanying it.

This Read Me file contains information about system requirements and installation instructions for the Linux builds of SeaMonkey. 

For more info on SeaMonkey, see http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/. To submit bugs or other feedback, see the Navigator QA menu and check out Bugzilla at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ for links to known bugs, bug-writing guidelines, and more. You can also get help with Bugzilla by pointing your IRC client to #mozillazine at irc.mozilla.org.


====================================================

                 Getting SeaMonkey

====================================================

You can download nightly builds of SeaMonkey from the mozilla.org FTP site at

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/

For the very latest builds, see

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/latest-trunk/

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by mozilla.org developers for testing, may be buggy. If you are looking for a more polished version of SeaMonkey, the SeaMonkey project releases builds of SeaMonkey regularly that you can download from

  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/
 
Be sure to read the SeaMonkey release notes for information on known problems and installation issues with SeaMonkey.  The release notes can be found at the preceding URL along with the releases themselves.

Note: Please use Talkback builds whenever possible. These builds allow transmission of crash data back to SeaMonkey and Mozilla developers, improved crash analysis, and posting of crash information to our crash-data newsgroup.


====================================================

               System Requirements

====================================================

* General

If you want to view and use the "Modern" theme, your display monitor should be set to display thousands of colors. For users who cannot set their displays to use more than 256 colors, the SeaMonkey project recommends using the "Classic" theme for SeaMonkey.

To select the Modern theme after you have installed SeaMonkey, from the browser, open the View menu, then open the Apply Theme submenu and choose Modern.

* Linux

- The following library versions (or compatible) are required: glibc 2.2.5, XFree86 3.3.x, GTK 1.2.x, Glib 1.2.x, Libstdc++ 2.9.0. Red Hat Linux 7.0, Debian 3.0, and SuSE 7.3 (or later) installations should work.
- Intel Pentium-class 233 MHz (or faster) processor
- 64MB RAM
- 26MB free hard disk space

            Installation Instructions

====================================================

Note that the installation instructions use the bash shell. If you're not using bash, adjust the commands accordingly.

Install into a clean (new) directory.  Installing on top of previously released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build SeaMonkey.  For info on building SeaMonkey from the mozilla.org source code, see

  http://www.mozilla.org/source.html


Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Note: If you install in the default directory (which is usually /usr/local/seamonkey), or any other directory where only the root user normally has write-access, you must start SeaMonkey first as root before other users can start the program. Doing so generates a set of files required for later use by other users.  However, do not use sudo to run the installer as root because that can damage your profile.


To install SeaMonkey by downloading the SeaMonkey installer, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named seamonkey (mkdir seamonkey) and change to that directory (cd seamonkey).
	
2. Click the link on the site you're downloading SeaMonkey from to download the installer file (called seamonkey-x.xx.en-US.linux-i686.installer.tar.gz or similar) to your machine.

3. Change to the seamonkey directory (cd seamonkey) and decompress the archive with the following command:

  tar zxvf sea*.tar.gz

The installer is now located in a subdirectory of seamonkey named seamonkey-installer.

4. Change to the seamonkey-installer directory (cd seamonkey-installer) and run the installer with the ./seamonkey-installer command.

5. Follow the instructions in the install wizard for installing SeaMonkey.

Note: If you have a slower machine, be aware that the installation may take some time. In this case, the installation progress may appear to hang indefinitely, even though the installation is still in process.

6. To start SeaMonkey, change to the directory where you installed it and run the ./seamonkey command.


To install SeaMonkey by downloading the tar.gz or tar.bz2 file:

Note: if you're using a tar.bz2 file, replace all occurrences of .gz in the following instructions with .bz2

1. Create a directory named "seamonkey" (mkdir seamonkey) and change to that directory (cd seamonkey).

2. Click the link on the site you're downloading SeaMonkey from to download the non-installer (seamonkey*.tar.gz) file into the seamonkey directory.

3. Change to the seamonkey directory (cd seamonkey) and decompress the file with the following command:

  tar zxvf sea*.tar.gz
	
This creates a "seamonkey" directory under your seamonkey directory. 

4. Change to the seamonkey directory (cd seamonkey). 

5. Run SeaMonkey with the following run script: 

  ./seamonkey


To hook up SeaMonkey complete with icon to the GNOME Panel, follow these steps:

1. Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu, and then open the Add to Panel submenu and choose Launcher.

2. Right-click the icon for SeaMonkey on the Panel and enter the following command:
  directory_name./seamonkey

where directory_name is the name of the directory you downloaded SeaMonkey to. For example, the default directory that SeaMonkey suggests is /usr/local/seamonkey.

3. Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment if you wish.

4. Click the icon button and type in the following as the icon's location:

  directory_name/chrome/icons/default/default.xpm

where directory_name is the directory where you installed SeaMonkey. For example, the default directory is /usr/local/seamonkey/chrome/icons/default/default.xpm.
