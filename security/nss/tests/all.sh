#
# Script to start all available NSS QA suites on one machine
# this script is called or sourced by nssqa which runs on all required 
# platforms
#
# needs to work on all Unix and Windows platforms
#
# currently available NSS QA suites:
# --------------------------------------------------
#   cert.sh   - exercises certutil and creates certs necessary for all 
#               other tests
#   ssl.sh    - tests SSL V2 SSL V3 and TLS
#   smime.sh  - S/MIME testing
#   crmf.sh   - CRMF/CMMF testing
#   sdr.sh    - test NSS SDR
#   cipher.sh - test NSS ciphers
#   perf.sh   - Nightly performance measurments
#   tools.sh  - Tests the majority of the NSS tools
#   fips.sh   - Tests basic functionallity of NSS in FIPS-compliant mode
#
# special strings
# ---------------
#   FIXME ... known problems, search for this string
#   NOTE .... unexpected behavior
#
# NOTE:
# -----
#    Unlike the old QA this is based on files sourcing each other
#    This is done to save time, since a great portion of time is lost
#    in calling and sourcing the same things multiple times over the
#    network. Also, this way all scripts have all shell function  available
#    and a completely common environment
#
# file tells the test suite that the output is going to a log, so any
#  forked() children need to redirect their output to prevent them from
#  being over written.
