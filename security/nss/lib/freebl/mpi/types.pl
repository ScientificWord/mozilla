# types.pl - find recommended type definitions for digits and words
#
# This script scans the Makefile for the C compiler and compilation
# flags currently in use, and using this combination, attempts to
# compile a simple test program that outputs the sizes of the various
# unsigned integer types, in bytes.  Armed with these, it finds all
# the "viable" type combinations for mp_digit and mp_word, where
# viability is defined by the requirement that mp_word be at least two
# times the precision of mp_digit.
#
# Of these, the one with the largest digit size is chosen, and
# appropriate typedef statements are written to standard output.
