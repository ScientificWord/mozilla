 * for which the private key is not available will fail.

 * NSSTrustDomain
 *
 * A Trust Domain is the field in which certificates may be validated.
 * A trust domain will generally have one or more cryptographic modules
 * open; these modules perform the cryptographic operations, and 
 * provide the basic "root" trust information from which the trust in
 * a specific certificate or key depends.
 *
 * A client program, or a simple server, would typically have one
 * trust domain.  A server supporting multiple "virtual servers" might
 * have a separate trust domain for each virtual server.  The separate
 * trust domains might share some modules (e.g., a hardware crypto
 * accelerator) but not others (e.g., the tokens storing the different
 * servers' private keys, or the databases with each server's trusted
 * root certificates).
 *
 * This object descends from the "permananet database" in the old code.

 * NSSCryptoContext
 *
 * A Crypto Context is a short-term, "helper" object which is used

 * operation may be the creation of a signed message, the use of an
 * TLS socket connection, etc.  Each crypto context is "in" a
 * specific trust domain, and it may have associated with it a
 * distinguished certificate, public key, private key, and/or
 * symmetric key.  It can also temporarily hold and use temporary
 * data (e.g. intermediate certificates) which is not stored
 * permanently in the trust domain.
 *
 * In OO terms, this interface inherits interfaces from the trust
 * domain, the certificates, and the keys.  It also provides
 * streaming crypto operations.
 *
 * This object descends from the "temporary database" concept in the
 * old code, but it has changed a lot as a result of what we've 
 * learned.
