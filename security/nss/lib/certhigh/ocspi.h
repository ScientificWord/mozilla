 * FUNCTION: cert_ProcessOCSPResponse

 *  available internally to this function).
 * INPUTS:
 *  CERTCertDBHandle *handle
 *    certificate DB of the cert that is being checked
 *  CERTOCSPResponse *response
 *    the OCSP response we want to retrieve status from.
 *  CERTOCSPCertID *certID
 *    the ID we want to look for from the response.
 *  CERTCertificate *signerCert
 *    the certificate that was used to sign the OCSP response.
 *    must be obtained via a call to CERT_VerifyOCSPResponseSignature.
 *  int64 time
 *    The time at which we're checking the status for.
 *  PRBool *certIDWasConsumed
 *    In and Out parameter.
 *    If certIDWasConsumed is NULL on input,
 *    this function might produce a deep copy of cert ID
 *    for storing it in the cache.
 *    If out value is true, ownership of parameter certID was
 *    transferred to the OCSP cache.
 *  SECStatus *cacheUpdateStatus
 *    This optional out parameter will contain the result
 *    of the cache update operation (if requested).
 *  RETURN:
 *    The return value is not influenced by the cache operation,
 *    it matches the documentation for CERT_CheckOCSPStatus
