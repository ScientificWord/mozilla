 * This structure contains an unordered set of AttributeTypeAndValue

 * a common object.
 *
 * Often, a single ATAV is sufficient to make a unique distinction.
 * For example, if a company assigns its people unique uid values,
 * then in the Name "uid=smith,ou=People,o=Acme,c=US" the "uid=smith"
 * ATAV by itself forms an RDN.  However, sometimes a set of ATAVs is
 * needed.  For example, if a company needed to distinguish between
 * two Smiths by specifying their corporate divisions, then in the
 * Name "(cn=Smith,ou=Sales),ou=People,o=Acme,c=US" the parenthesised
 * set of ATAVs forms the RDN.
