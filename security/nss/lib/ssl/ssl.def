;+#   1. For all unix platforms, the string ";-"  means "remove this line"
;+#   2. For all unix platforms, the string " DATA " will be removed from any 
;+#     line on which it occurs.
;+#   3. Lines containing ";+" will have ";+" removed on SUN and LINUX.
;+#      On AIX, lines containing ";+" will be removed.
;+#   4. For all unix platforms, the string ";;" will thave the ";;" removed.
;+#   5. For all unix platforms, after the above processing has taken place,
;+#    all characters after the first ";" on the line will be removed.
;+#    And for AIX, the first ";" will also be removed.
;+#  This file is passed directly to windows. Since ';' is a comment, all UNIX
;+#   directives are hidden behind ";", ";+", and ";-"
