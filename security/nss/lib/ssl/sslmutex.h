/* What SSL really wants is portable process-shared unnamed mutexes in 
 * shared memory, that have the property that if the process that holds
 * them dies, they are released automatically, and that (unlike fcntl 
 * record locking) lock to the thread, not to the process.  
 * NSPR doesn't provide that.  
 * Windows has mutexes that meet that description, but they're not portable.  
 * POSIX mutexes are not automatically released when the holder dies, 
 * and other processes/threads cannot release the mutex on behalf of the 
 * dead holder.  
 * POSIX semaphores can be used to accomplish this on systems that implement 
 * process-shared unnamed POSIX semaphores, because a watchdog thread can 
 * discover and release semaphores that were held by a dead process.  
 * On systems that do not support process-shared POSIX unnamed semaphores, 
 * they can be emulated using pipes.  
 * The performance cost of doing that is not yet measured.
 *
 * So, this API looks a lot like POSIX pthread mutexes.
