 * ARENA_DESTRUCTOR_LIST
 *
 * Unfortunately, our pointer-tracker facility, used in debug
 * builds to agressively fight invalid pointers, requries that
 * pointers be deregistered when objects are destroyed.  This
 * conflicts with the standard arena usage where "memory-only"
 * objects (that don't hold onto resources outside the arena)
 * can be allocated in an arena, and never destroyed other than
 * when the arena is destroyed.  Therefore we have added a
 * destructor-registratio facility to our arenas.  This was not
 * a simple decision, since we're getting ever-further away from
 * the original arena philosophy.  However, it was felt that
 * adding this in debug builds wouldn't be so bad; as it would
 * discourage them from being used for "serious" purposes.
 * This facility requires ARENA_THREADMARK to be defined.
