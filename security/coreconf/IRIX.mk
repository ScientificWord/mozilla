# Revision notes:
#
# In the IRIX compilers prior to version 7.2, -n32 implied -mips3.
# Beginning in the 7.2 compilers, -n32 implies -mips4 when the compiler
# is running on a system with a mips4 CPU (e.g. R8K, R10K).
# We want our code to explicitly be mips3 code, so we now explicitly
# set -mips3 whenever we set -n32.
