# One can define the makefile variable NSDISTMODE to control
# how files are published to the 'dist' directory.  If not
# defined, the default is "install using relative symbolic
# links".  The two possible values are "copy", which copies files
# but preserves source mtime, and "absolute_symlink", which
# installs using absolute symbolic links.
#   - THIS IS NOT PART OF THE NEW BINARY RELEASE PLAN for 9/30/97
#   - WE'RE KEEPING IT ONLY FOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
