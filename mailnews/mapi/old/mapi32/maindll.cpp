   FUNCTION: DllMain(HANDLE, DWORD, LPVOID)

   PURPOSE:  DllMain is called by Windows when
             the DLL is initialized, Thread Attached, and other times.
             Refer to SDK documentation, as to the different ways this
             may be called.
             
             The DllMain function should perform additional initialization
             tasks required by the DLL.  In this example, no initialization
             tasks are required.  DllMain should return a value of 1 if
             the initialization is successful.
