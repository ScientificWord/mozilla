/* MimeSunAttachment is the class for X-Sun-Attachment message contents, which
   is the Content-Type assigned by that pile of garbage called MailTool.  This
   is not a MIME type per se, but it's very similar to multipart/mixed, so it's
   easy to parse.  Lots of people use MailTool, so what the hell.

   The format is this:

    = Content-Type is X-Sun-Attachment
	= parts are separated by lines of exactly ten dashes
	= just after the dashes comes a block of headers, including:

      X-Sun-Data-Type: (manditory)
			Values are Text, Postscript, Scribe, SGML, TeX, Troff, DVI,
			and Message.

      X-Sun-Encoding-Info: (optional)
	  		Ordered, comma-separated values, including Compress and Uuencode.

      X-Sun-Data-Name: (optional)
	  		File name, maybe.

      X-Sun-Data-Description: (optional)
			Longer text.

      X-Sun-Content-Lines: (manditory, unless Length is present)
			Number of lines in the body, not counting headers and the blank
			line that follows them.

      X-Sun-Content-Length: (manditory, unless Lines is present)
	  		Bytes, presumably using Unix line terminators.
