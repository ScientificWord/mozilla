/* The MimeInlineText class is the superclass of all handlers for the
   MIME text/ content types (which convert various text formats to HTML,
   in one form or another.)

   It provides two services:

     =  if ROT13 decoding is desired, the text will be rotated before
	    the `parse_line' method it called;

	 =  text will be converted from the message's charset to the "target"
        charset before the `parse_line' method is called.

   The contract with charset-conversion is that the converted data will
   be such that one may interpret any octets (8-bit bytes) in the data
   which are in the range of the ASCII characters (0-127) as ASCII
   characters.  It is explicitly legal, for example, to scan through
   the string for "<" and replace it with "&lt;", and to search for things
   that look like URLs and to wrap them with interesting HTML tags.

   The charset to which we convert will probably be UTF-8 (an encoding of
   the Unicode character set, with the feature that all octets with the
   high bit off have the same interpretations as ASCII.)

   #### NOTE: if it turns out that we use JIS (ISO-2022-JP) as the target
        encoding, then this is not quite true; it is safe to search for the
		low ASCII values (under hex 0x40, octal 0100, which is '@') but it
		is NOT safe to search for values higher than that -- they may be
		being used as the subsequent bytes in a multi-byte escape sequence.
		It's a nice coincidence that HTML's critical characters ("<", ">",
		and "&") have values under 0x40...
