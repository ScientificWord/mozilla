What is this plug-in?
---------------------

This is a Linux/Mozilla plug-in that enables a scanner/digital 
camera application to be created with JavaScript. To this end
the SANE plug-in provides two things:
	
	1. I have attempted to export all of the SANE API's 
	   from the SANE native libraries to JavaScript.
           (I have provided two brain-dead samples for a 
           CPia USB digital camera and HP 6300 scanner.)

	2. A drawing surface for displaying the scanned image. 

=====================================================================

Why did you bother?
------------------

Originally, I used this plug-in to cut my teeth on the new Mozilla
XPCom plug-in model.  Now I am hoping to provide a Linux/Mozilla
plug-in sample that exercises most of the functionality that the 
Linux community would want to use (like connecting JavaScript
to native code.) 

=====================================================================

You know, Linux isn't the only UN*X around!
-------------------------------------------

I say Linux because that is the only platform I have built/tested on.
SANE is supported by a long list of UN*X OS's so there is no reason
that other platforms shouldn't work with this plug-in.

(I have tried to stick to NSPR functions for this reason, but it's easy
to over look a couple of Linux specific functions.)

======================================================================

How do I build this beast?
-------------------------

In order to build this plug-in, you need the SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) libraries/headers installed on your system.  For more
info on SANE, go to http://www.mostang.com/sane.
