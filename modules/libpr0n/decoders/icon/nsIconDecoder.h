//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The icon decoder is a decoder specifically tailored for loading icons 
// from the OS. We've defined our own little format to represent these icons
// and this decoder takes that format and converts it into 24-bit RGB with alpha channel
// support. It was modeled a bit off the PPM decoder.
//
// Assumptions about the decoder:
// (1) We receive ALL of the data from the icon channel in one OnDataAvailable call. We don't
//     support multiple ODA calls yet.
// (2) the format of the incoming data is as follows:
//     The first two bytes contain the width and the height of the icon. 
//     The third byte contains the number of bits per pixel in the alpha
//       channel (either 1 or 8).
//     Followed by 3 bytes per pixel for the color bitmap row after row,
//       from top to bottom, with pixels left to right within rows, and
//       RGB order within pixels, in platform endianness.
//     Followed by alpha data (1 or 8 bits per pixel, see above) in the
//       same order as the RGB data, and also in platform endianness.
