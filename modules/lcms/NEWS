 New in ver 1.17
 ===============
  
Changes in API
----------------------

WIN64 support
_vsnprintf wrap
BOOL replaced by LCMSBOOL
cmsSetLanguage parameters changed to match ICC spec
removed support for extended gamut descriptor (was never fully implemented)
cmsFLAGS_NODEFAULTRESOURCEDEF moved to 0x01000000
_cmsMalloc wrapper for malloc
_cmsFree wrapper for free


Implementation
----------------------
All errors moved to fatal, since there is no easy recovery strategy
Vulnerability fixes on cmsio1.c 
Status check, many functions now check the status when calling other functions. Improved robustness against ill-formed profiles.
_cmsSaveProfile didn't copy tags from a file based profile, fixed.


Utilities
----------
icctrans: CMYKcm support wrongly implemented, fixed.
icclink: linking 3 to 7 channels didn't work in some cases, fixed.
