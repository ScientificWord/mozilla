This is sqlite 3.5.4.1

See http://www.sqlite.org/ for more info.

We have a mozilla-specific Makefile.in in src/ (normally no
Makefile.in there) that we use to build.

To move to a new version:

Simply copy the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files from the amalgamation of sqlite.

If mozstorage or nss code need changes due to API changes in sqlite3, be sure
to update SQLITE_VERSION accordingly in $(topsrcdir)/configure.in.
