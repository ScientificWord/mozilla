/*| morkSink is intended to be a very cheap buffered i/o sink which
**| writes to bufs and other strings a single byte at a time.  The
**| basic idea is that writing a single byte has a very cheap average
**| cost, because a polymophic function call need only occur when the
**| space between At and End is exhausted.  The rest of the time a
**| very cheap inline method will write a byte, and then bump a pointer.
**|
**|| At: the current position in some sequence of bytes at which to
**| write the next byte put into the sink.  Presumably At points into
**| the private storage of some space which is not yet filled (except
**| when At reaches End, and the overflow must then spill).  Note both
**| At and End are zeroed in the destructor to help show that a sink
**| is no longer usable; this is safe because At==End causes the case
**| where SpillPutc() is called to handled an exhausted buffer space.
**|
**|| End: an address one byte past the last byte which can be written
**| without needing to make a buffer larger than previously.  When At
**| and End are equal, this means there is no space to write a byte,
**| and that some underlying buffer space must be grown before another
**| byte can be written.  Note At must always be less than or equal to
**| End, and otherwise an important invariant has failed severely.
**|
**|| Buf: this original class slot has been commented out in the new
**| and more abstract version of this sink class, but the general idea
**| behind this slot should be explained to help design subclasses.
**| Each subclass should provide space into which At and End can point,
**| where End is beyond the last writable byte, and At is less than or
**| equal to this point inside the same buffer.  With some kinds of
**| medium, such as writing to an instance of morkBlob, it is feasible
**| to point directly into the final resting place for all the content
**| written to the medium.  Other mediums such as files, which write
**| only through function calls, will typically need a local buffer
**| to efficiently accumulate many bytes between such function calls.
**|
**|| FlushSink: this flush method should move any buffered content to 
**| it's final destination.  For example, for buffered writes to a
**| string medium, where string methods are function calls and not just
**| inline macros, it is faster to accumulate many bytes in a small
**| local buffer and then move these en masse later in a single call.
**|
**|| SpillPutc: when At is greater than or equal to End, this means an
**| underlying buffer has become full, so the buffer must be flushed
**| before a new byte can be written.  The intention is that SpillPutc()
**| will be equivalent to calling FlushSink() followed by another call
**| to Putc(), where the flush is expected to make At less then End once
**| again.  Except that FlushSink() need not make the underlying buffer
**| any larger, and SpillPutc() typically must make room for more bytes.
**| Note subclasses might want to guard against the case that both At
**| and End are null, which happens when a sink is destroyed, which sets
**| both these pointers to null as an indication the sink is disabled.
