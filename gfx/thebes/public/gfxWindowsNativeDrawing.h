     * This class assumes that native drawing can take place only if
     * the destination surface has a content type of COLOR (that is,
     * RGB24), and that the transformation matrix consists of only a
     * translation (in which case the coordinates are munged directly)
     * or a translation and scale (in which case SetWorldTransform is used).
     *
     * If the destination is of a non-win32 surface type, a win32
     * surface of content COLOR_ALPHA, or if there is a complex
     * transform (i.e., one with rotation) set, then the native drawing
     * code will fall back to alpha recovery, but will still take advantage
     * of native axis-aligned scaling.
     *
     * Typical usage looks like:
     *
     *   gfxWindowsNativeDrawing nativeDraw(ctx, destGfxRect);
     *   do {
     *     HDC dc = nativeDraw.BeginNativeDrawing();
     *     if (!dc)
     *       return NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
     *
     *     RECT winRect;
     *     nativeDraw.TransformToNativeRect(rect, winRect);
     *
     *       ... call win32 operations on HDC to draw to winRect ...
     *
     *     nativeDraw.EndNativeDrawing();
     *   } while (nativeDraw.ShouldRenderAgain());
     *   nativeDraw.PaintToContext();
