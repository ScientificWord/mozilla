Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.  A git branch
of this version of cairo is available at

	vladimir@git.cairographics.org:~vladimir/cairo

in the 'mozilla-tree-cairo' branch.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.
