    /* For most cairo objects, the rule for multiple threads is that
     * the user is responsible for any locking if the same object is
     * manipulated from multiple threads simultaneously.
     *
     * However, with the caching that cairo does for scaled fonts, a
     * user can easily end up with the same cairo_scaled_font object
     * being manipulated from multiple threads without the user ever
     * being aware of this, (and in fact, unable to control it).
     *
     * So, as a special exception, the cairo implementation takes care
     * of all locking needed for cairo_scaled_font_t. Most of what is
     * in the scaled font is immutable, (which is what allows for the
     * sharing in the first place). The things that are modified and
     * the locks protecting them are as follows:
     *
     * 1. The reference count (scaled_font->ref_count)
     *
     *    Modifications to the reference count are protected by the
     *    _cairo_scaled_font_map_mutex. This is because the reference
     *    count of a scaled font is intimately related with the font
     *    map itself, (and the magic holdovers array).
     *
     * 2. The cache of glyphs (scaled_font->glyphs)
     * 3. The backend private data (scaled_font->surface_backend,
     *				    scaled_font->surface_private)
     *
     *    Modifications to these fields are protected with locks on
     *    scaled_font->mutex in the generic scaled_font code.
