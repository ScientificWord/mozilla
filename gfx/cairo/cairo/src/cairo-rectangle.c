/* XXX We currently have a confusing mix of boxes and rectangles as
 * exemplified by this function.  A #cairo_box_t is a rectangular area
 * represented by the coordinates of the upper left and lower right
 * corners, expressed in fixed point numbers.  A #cairo_rectangle_int_t is
 * also a rectangular area, but represented by the upper left corner
 * and the width and the height, as integer numbers.
 *
 * This function converts a #cairo_box_t to a #cairo_rectangle_int_t by
 * increasing the area to the nearest integer coordinates.  We should
 * standardize on #cairo_rectangle_fixed_t and #cairo_rectangle_int_t, and
 * this function could be renamed to the more reasonable
 * _cairo_rectangle_fixed_round.
