 * @scaled_font_glyph_index: the index of the glyph to be mapped
 * @font_id_ret: return value giving the font ID of the mapped glyph
 * @subset_id_ret: return value giving the subset ID of the mapped glyph within the @font_id_ret
 * @subset_glyph_index_ret: return value giving the index of the mapped glyph within the @subset_id_ret subset
 * 
 * Map a glyph from a #cairo_scaled_font to a new index within a
 * subset of that font. The mapping performed is from the tuple:
 *
 *	(scaled_font, scaled_font_glyph_index)
 *
 * to the tuple:
 *
 *	(font_id, subset_id, subset_glyph_index)
 *
 * This mapping is 1:1. If the input tuple has previously mapped, the
 * the output tuple previously returned will be returned again.
 *
 * Otherwise, the return tuple will be constructed as follows:
 *
 * 1) There is a 1:1 correspondence between the input scaled_font
 *    value and the output font_id value. If no mapping has been
 *    previously performed with the scaled_font value then the
 *    smallest unused font_id value will be returned.
 *
 * 2) Within the set of output tuples of the same font_id value the
 *    smallest value of subset_id will be returned such that
 *    subset_glyph_index does not exceed max_glyphs_per_subset (as
 *    passed to _cairo_scaled_font_subsets_create()) and that the
 *    resulting tuple is unique.
 *
 * 3) The smallest value of subset_glyph_index is returned such that
 *    the resulting tuple is unique.
 *
 * The net result is that any #cairo_scaled_font_t will be represented
 * by one or more font subsets. Each subset is effectively a tuple of
 * (scaled_font, font_id, subset_id) and within each subset there
 * exists a mapping of scaled_glyph_font_index to subset_glyph_index.
 *
 * This final description of a font subset is the same representation
 * used by #cairo_scaled_font_subset_t as provided by
 * _cairo_scaled_font_subsets_foreach.
 *
 * Return value: CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, or a non-zero
 * value indicating an error. Possible errors include
 * CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY.
