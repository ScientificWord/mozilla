<h2>ActiveState Tool Corporation</h2>
<p>The Python XPCOM Package was developed primarily by <a href="mailto:markh@activestate.com">Mark
Hammond</a> of <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com">ActiveState Tool Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>The developers on the <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo">Komodo
project</a> deserve high praise for putting up with early versions when almost
nothing worked, and for believing in Python as a viable XPCOM language.&nbsp;
Their feedback and patience has allowed the first public release to be amazingly
functional and bug-free.</p>

<h2>Mozilla/Netscape</h2>
<p>The following people at <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>
(or not there but still heavily involved in the project) have provided enormous
help in getting things integrated with their build system, answering us on the
newsgroup, teaching us the finer points of XPCOM, gently slapping us for accidentally
referring to <i>jscript</i>, etc., and otherwise lending us a clue in the
Mozilla/Netscape/XPCOM world.</p>
