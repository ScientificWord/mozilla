# JAR manifest for the pyxultest chrome

# http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/jar.mn tells me that this file is
# only used by the Mozilla build process (although I'm not sure exactly now!)

# As most apps will be outside the mozilla tree and presumably have their 
# own build process, they probably don't need this file.
#
# Clarifications and simplifications welcome!
