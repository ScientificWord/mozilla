Caveat = Saving Passwords and Other Sensitive Information##Password Manager and Form Manager will save passwords, user names, and other sensitive information and enter them for you automatically when they are required.#This sensitive information is stored on your computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, to read.#If other people have access to your computer, you may want to password protect the stored sensitive information by choosing a Master Password.#If you choose to password protect your stored information, you will be asked to provide your Master Password from time to time.  This approach provides better security but is slightly less convenient.
