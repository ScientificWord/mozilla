ActivationWarning=Be warned that the roaming implementation is still new and experimental. It may accidently overwrite your roaming profile files (both on the server and locally) with a bad or empty version. Please make regular backups of your profile to prevent possible data loss. See the release notes or ask your administrator for where you can find the files. Please report any dataloss bugs you find. This warning won't be shown anymore for this profile.
