Bugs
====================================================================================================

GLOBAL
2. Put access keys on all menus
-
* Auto-scrolling is busted
    
THEME
* Create mousedown version of Mac twisty - darker arrow

EDITOR
* Context menu of inline editors obscured by firebug context menu

INSPECTOR

CONSOLE
1. Check blacklist to hide errors by domain (they show up in other tabs)
2. Context menu for events should include option to disable logging events for original target

HTML
1. Editing table nodes fails - need to create them using innerHTML inside of another table
2. Rows of really deeply nested HTML trees get cut off on the right side
2. Mutation events not applied to iframes sometimes, seems after page reload (test on Gwen)

CSS
1. Escape in big CSS editor doesn't revert values on refreshed view
1. Remove empty warning message when inserting first style rule
* Shorthand rules don't get inheritance crossed out (margin -> margin-top)

DEBUGGER
1. Show error breakpoints as red dot next to line number with "e" glyph
1. Detection of when call stack goes to 0 doesn't always work (when caller is top-level script)
    * See http://www.apple.com/pro/ getXML() to test
    * OnScriptDestroyed is how we detect a top-level script has "returned"
3. Loading a "streaming" page locks up until the page loads
    * Re-write script display to display streaming pages incrementally while they load

DOM
1. Disable and re-enable Firebug and DOM window winds up empty
2. Clicking built-in functions shouldn't take you to script tab (console builtin map)
2. Make list of read-only DOM properties and disallow editing them
2. Editing prototype of DOM function prototypes causes weird things to happen
3. Make inline editor cover only the property value, with shadow and all

SPY

NET
* Show time from start of request until first byte comes in
1. Net caching not always accurately reported
1. Option to copy post variables as a GET concatenated string
1. Sometimes post and response text don't show for XHRs, but they do show in Console
1. Switching file filters should hide expanded tabs as well
1. Document load is once again showing up early in the previous page
    * Real problem is that time spent before page switch is subtracted
* Indicate gzippedness somehow

PERF/STABILITY
1. Logged events crashing, must not be throwing away the original event as intended
1. Don't forget to uninitialize infotip on browsers on disabling and on shutdown
1. Don't store pointer to debugger in monitor()
-
* bind is REALLY slow - replace with faster, less flexible version (esp. in domplates)
* Getting long watch lists seems to be slow - benchmark time vs. for loop
