 base --- core source code for XMLterm and LineTerm

XMLterm may be invoked in one of two ways:
 1. By loading "-chrome chrome://xmlterm/content/xmlterm.xul" in mozilla, or
 2. By running the stand-alone executable "../geckoterm/xmlterm".
The diagram below shows the control-flow/layering hierarchy for both ways
of invoking XMLterm.

FILES:

The core source code for XMLterm in this directory consists of two distinct
families of files, those with names that begin with the prefix "moz" and all
the other files. The former are the Mozilla-specific portions of XMLterm,
written in C++. The remaining files constitute the Mozilla-independent portion
of XMLterm, referred to as "LineTerm".

============================================================================
LINETERM:

LineTerm is a line-oriented terminal program, in some respects similar in
functionality to the GNU Readline package. It is completely independent of the
Mozilla source code, is written in plain C, and dually licensed under GPL and
MPL.

============================================================================
INTERFACES:

lineterm.h              Plain C interface to LineTerm
                          (used by mozLineTerm)

mozILineTerm.idl        Scriptable XPCOM/XPCONNECT interface to LineTerm
                          (not used at the moment)

mozILineTermAux.h       XPCOM interface to LineTerm, with extra features
                          (used by mozXMLTerminal)
 
mozIXMLTermShell.h      Scriptable XPCOM/XPCONNECT interface to XMLterm
                          (used by the Javascript glue code in the XMLterm
                           start page at ../ui/content/xmlterm.html)

mozIXMLTerminal.h       XPCOM interface to XMLterm
                          (used by mozXMLTermShell, ../geckoterm/mozGeckoterm)

mozIXMLTermStream.h     XPCOM interface for displaying HTML/XML streams in
                          IFRAMES (used by mozXMLTermSession)
