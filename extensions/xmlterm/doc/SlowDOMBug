Appending each output line separately, separated by <BR> elements, to a
displayed HTML document seems to be rather slow. See the file
base/mozXMLTermSession.cpp

As a workaround, multiple output lines are batched into a single <PRE>
element. This will basically only work for plain text output, without markup.
To disable this workaround and expose the "bug", create the XMLterm libraries
as described in the INSTALL file. Then execute the following to make the
"buggy" libraries:

cd base
rm mozXMLTermSession.o
make NO_WORKAROUND=1 mozXMLTermSession.o
make libs

(If you are using the "gterm" executable, you will need to re-make it as
well)

Now execute any command which produces several lines of output in an
XMLterm window.
