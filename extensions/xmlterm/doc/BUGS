Known bugs
----------

23 Oct 2000

1. Mozilla bug (Solaris only): The cursor has disappeared! (also in Composer)

2. DOM/IFRAME bug: window.document object not defined for dynamically
   created IFRAME elements using DOM. Currently prevent the use of IFRAMEs
   for inline display of HTML documents

3. XMLterm bug: Typing text in text input element causes input to be duplicated
   in the command line. Controlled by Javascript WORKAROUND in xmlterm.html
   to detect onFocus and onBlur events and suspend key event handling by
   mozXMLTermKeyListener

4. DOM/Layout bug: When cursor is at leftmost position on the line, clicking
   on the window moves it up (very annoying). Mitigated by a WORKAROUND in
   mozXMLTermMouseListener::MouseClick.

5. XMLterm/DOM bug: As new commands are typed in, scrolling is jerky. For
   example, type a few non-trivial commands interspersed with several
   trivial commands (i.e., just pressing ENTER key). The output from the
   earlier non-trivial commands sometimes jumps downwards instead of moving
   monotonically upwards. (Does it have anything to do with deletion of
   earlier DOM entries?)

6. XMLterm bug: Arrow keys are hard-wired to particular escape sequences.

7. LTERM/NCURSES bug: Executing "emacs -nw" in the NCURSES version of LTERM
   results in LTERM exiting abnormally when user exits emacs. An interrupt
   error seems to occur while polling for output in ltermRead.

8. "Here document" input positions cursor incorrectly in the previous line.

9. "yes" command causes xmlterm to hang!

10. F1 key sometimes blanks out whole screen and makes it unresponsive.

11. Style changes have become fickle, e.g., prompt underlining doesn't seem
    to work properly.

12. cd /usr/share/pixmaps/mc
    xcat i-symlink.png

    causes crash (seems to be related to GTK event callback)
    Switching to XP event posting may remove this bug
