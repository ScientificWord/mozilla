doc --- Some implementation notes and documentation

This directory contains some rudimentary documentation and notes.
See the README file in the "base" directory (../base/README) for a brief
overview of XMLterm code architecture

For a discussion of XMLterm from the user's point of view, check the XMLterm
home page at <http://xmlterm.org>.

Eventually, an XMLterm project page at mozilla.org
<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/not-ready-yet/> will contain a description
of XMLterm architecture from a Mozilla developer's point of view.
