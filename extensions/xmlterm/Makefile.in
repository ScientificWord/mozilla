# makefile for xmlterm root directory

# XMLterm currently works only on Linux and Solaris platforms.
# This makefile is configured to do nothing on other platforms.

# It should be possible to make XMLterm work on other Unix
# platforms, but you need to do the following:
# 1. Ensure that the pseudo-TTY implementation (ptystream.c)
#    works on the platform
# 2. Ensure that a WCHAR implementation is available
# 3. Modify this Makefile.in and config/xmlterm_config.mk
#    to recognize the new platform
