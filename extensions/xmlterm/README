xmlterm --- A graphical command line interface
==============================================

An early prototype of XMLterm, an XTERM-like terminal program implemented
using the open source Mozilla layout engine, is now available to tinker
with. XMLterm aims to add graphical and hypertext capabilities to the XTERM
command line interface, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

The basic design philosophy of XMLterm is that the user interface is a dynamic
XML document. The user and the computer interact by taking turns at appending
to this XML document. The plain text content of the XML document, i.e.,
excluding any markup, corresponds to the plain text that would be displayed by
a plain XTERM. The markup in the XML document is used to add graphical and
hypertext features. XMLterm uses the Mozilla layout engine to display the XML
document.

XMLterm is an open source project in its early stages. Comments and
contributions are welcome!

QUICK SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS (Linux/Solaris)
-----------------------------------------

If you have already built mozilla from the source, then type the following
commands in the "mozilla" directory to build XMLterm:

a) configure --with-extensions=xmlterm <other-configure-options>
b) cd extensions/xmlterm
c) make

[Skip step (b) for a fresh build of mozilla from the source tarball]

To execute XMLterm, type one of the following commands in
the mozilla/dist/bin directory:

   ./xmlterm
  OR
   ./mozilla -chrome chrome://xmlterm/content/xmlterm.xul

NOTES:

 1. See the INSTALL file for detailed configuration/installation instructions.

 2. See the file doc/INSTALL.xmlterm for binary installation instructions.

 3. Check the XMLterm web site <http://xmlterm.org> for updates.

===========================================================================
DOCUMENTATION

 a. There is a README file in each directory that provides some basic
    information.

 b. The file "base/README" provides a brief overview of the XMLterm code
    architecture.

 c. The header files (*.idl, *.h) have comments describing class methods
    and member variables in JAVADOC format. Look at them before delving
    into the *.cpp files
