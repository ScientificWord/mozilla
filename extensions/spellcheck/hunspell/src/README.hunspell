Hunspell Version: 1.1.12

Hunspell Author: László Németh
MySpell Author: Kevin Hendricks & David Einstein

Hunspell is a spell checker and morphological analyser library. Hunspell
is based on OpenOffice.org's Myspell. Documentation, tests, and examples
are available at http://hunspell.sourceforge.net.

A special thanks and credit goes to Geoff Kuenning, the creator of Ispell.
MySpell's affix algorithms were based on those of Ispell, which should be
noted is copyright Geoff Kuenning et al and now available under a BSD-style
license. For more information on Ispell and affix compression in general,
please see: http://lasr.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html (Ispell homepage)

An almost complete rewrite of MySpell for use by the Mozilla project was
developed by David Einstein. David was a significant help in improving MySpell.

Special thanks also goes to László Németh, who is the author of the Hungarian
dictionary and who developed and contributed the code to support compound words
in MySpell and fixed numerous problems with the encoding case conversion tables
along with rewriting MySpell as Hunspell and ensuring compatibility with the
Mozilla codebase.
