// Notes regarding the ownership model between the nsSOAPEncoding (encoding)
//   and the nsSOAPEncodingRegsitry (registry). To avoid cyclic referencing
//   and thereby leaking encodings and the registry holding them the registry 
//   was given ownership of the encodings. In the encoding specialized 
//   AddRef() and Release() functions were written to pass the refcounting
//   to the registry. Instead of ref couting the encodings all refs are
//   accumulated in the registry. When the registry is the only thing holding
//   on to the encodings it's own refcount will hit zero causing it to 
//   go away and take with it any encodings stored in its hashtable. To make
//   this work the registry had to be a weak reference (*-style pointer)
//   in each encoding and the storage of the encodings had to be weak as
//   well (*-style pointers in the nsObjectHashtable).
